      <description>Find the Symmetric Difference The mathematical term symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both. For example, for sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, A △ B = {1, 4}.
Symmetric difference is a binary operation, which means it operates on only two elements. So to evaluate an expression involving symmetric differences among three elements (A △ B △ C), you must complete one operation at a time.</description>
