<p>Preface</p>

<p>“Is Go an object-oriented language? Yes and no.”
Frequently asked questions
GO AUTHORS
Audience
This is an introduction to the Go language from Google. Its aim is to provide a guide to this new and innovative language.
This book assumes you already have Go installed on your system.
The intended audience of this book is people who are familiar with programming and
know
some
programming
languages,
be
it
C[3],
C++[21],
Perl[5],
Java[15],
Erlang[4],
Scala[16]</p>

<p>or
Haskell[1].
This
is
not a book that teaches you how to program, this is a book that just
teaches you how to use Go.</p>

<p>As with learning new things, probably the best way to do this is to discover it for yourself by creating your own programs. Each chapter therefore includes a number of exercises (and answers) to acquaint you with the language. An exercise is numbered as Qn, where n is a number. After the exercise number another number in parentheses displays the dif.culty of this particular assignment. This dif.culty ranges from 0 to 2:
0.
easy;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>intermediate;</p></li>

<li><p>dif.cult.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then a short name is given, for easier reference. For example:
Q1. (1) A map function …
introduces a question numbered Q1 of a level 1 dif.culty, concerning a map()-function. The answers are included after the exercises on a new page. The numbering and setup of the answers is identical to the exercises, except that an answer starts with An, where the number n corresponds with the number of the exercise. Some exercises don’t have an answer; these are marked with an asterisk.</p>

<p>Book layout
Chapter 1: Introduction  Describes the basic types, variables and control structures available in the lan­guage.
Chapter 2: Functions  In the third chapter we look at functions, the basic building blocks of Go programs.
Chapter 3: Packages  In chapter 3 we see that functions and data can be grouped together in packages. You will also see how to document and test your packages.
Chapter 4: Beyond the basics  After that we look at creating your own types in chapter 4. It also looks at allocation in Go.
Chapter 5: Interfaces  Go does not support object orientation in the traditional sense. In Go the central concept is interfaces.
Chapter 6: Concurrency With the go keyword functions can be started in separate routines (called gorou­tines). Communication with those goroutines is done via channels.
Chapter 7: Communication In the last chapter we show how to interface with the rest of the world from within a Go program. How to create .les and read and write from and to them. We also brie.y look into networking. I hope you will enjoy this book and the language Go.</p>

<p>1 Introduction</p>

<p>When searching on the internet use the term “golang” in­stead of plain “go”.</p>

<p>The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and ef.cient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multi core and networked machines, while its novel type system enables .exible and mod­ular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the con­venience of garbage collection and the power of run-time re.ection. It’s a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
Go 1 is the .rst stable release of the language Go. This document and all exercises work
with Go 1 – if not, it’s a bug.
The following convention is used throughout this book:</p>

<p>• Code, keywords and comments are displayed in Source Code Pro;</p>

<p>• Extra remarks in the code + Are displayed like this;</p>

<p>• Longer remarks get a number – 1 – with the explanation following;</p>

<p>• Line numbers (if needed) are printed on the right side;</p>

<p>• Shell examples use a % as prompt;</p>

<p>• User entered text in shell examples is in bold, system responses are in a plain bold font;</p>

<p>• An emphasized paragraph is indented and has a vertical bar on the left.</p>

<p>O.cial documentation
There is already a substantial amount of documentation written about Go.</p>

<p>The Go Tutorial [12], and the Effective Go document [8]. The website <a href="http://golang.org/doc/">http://golang.org/doc/</a> is a very good starting point for reading up on Goa. Reading these documents is certainly not required, but it is recommended.
Go 1 comes with its own documentation in the form of a program called godoc. If you are interested in the documentation for the built-ins (see “Operators and built-in functions”
in the next chapter) you can .re it up, like so:
% godoc builtin</p>

<p>How to create your own package documentation is explained in chapter 3.</p>

<p>There are a few things that make Go different from other languages.</p>

<p>Clean and Simple</p>

<p>Go strives to keep things small and beautiful. You should be able to do a lot in only a few lines of code;
ahttp://golang.org/doc/ itself is served by godoc.</p>

<p>Concurrent</p>

<p>Go makes it easy to “.re off” functions to be run as very lightweight threads. These threads are called goroutines b
in Go; Channels Communication with these goroutines is done via channels [25, 18];</p>

<p>Fast
Compilation is fast and execution is fast. The aim is to be as fast as C. Compilation time is measured in seconds;</p>

<p>Safe
Explicit casting and strict rules when converting one type to another. Go has garbage collection, no more free() in Go, the language takes care of this;</p>

<p>Standard format
A Go program can be formatted in (almost) any way the programmers want, but an of.cial format exists. The rule is very simple: The output of the .lter gofmt is the of.cially endorsed format.
Post.x types Types are given after the variable name, thus var a int, instead of int a; as one would in C;
UTF-8 UTF-8 is everywhere, in strings and in the program code. Finally you can use &lt; = &lt; +1 in your source code;</p>

<p>Open Source
The Go license is completely open source, see the .le LICENSE in the Go source code distribution;</p>

<p>Fun
Programming with Go should be fun!</p>

<p>Erlang [4] also shares some of the features of Go.</p>

<p>Notable differences between Erlang and Go is that Erlang borders on being a functional language, where Go is an imperative one. And Erlang runs in a virtual machine, while Go is compiled. Go also has a much more Unix-like feel to it.
Go is the .rst C–like language that is widely available, runs on many different platforms and makes concurrency easy (or easier).</p>

<p>Hello World
In the Go tutorial, Go is presented to the world in the typical manner: letting it print “Hello World” (Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie started this when they presented the C language in the 1970s). We don’t think we can do better, so here it is, “Hello World” in Go.</p>

<p>Listing 1.1. Hello world
package main
0 import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;
1 // Implements formatted I/O.
  /* Print something */
2 func main() {
3 fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Hello, world; or aa&gt;1µ´aó.µ.; or&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;)
..a
}</p>

<p>bYes, that sounds a lot like coroutines, but goroutines are slightly different as we will see in chapter 6.</p>

<p>Lets look at the program line by line.</p>

<p>0 This .rst line is just required. All Go .les start with package <something>, package main is required for a standalone executable;</p>

<p>1   This says we need fmt in addition to main. A package other than main is commonly called a library, a familiar concept in many programming languages (see chapter 3).
The line ends with a comment which is started with //;</p>

<p>2 This is also a comment, but this one is enclosed in /* and */;</p>

<p>3   Just as package main was required to be .rst, import may come next. In Go, package is always .rst, then import, then everything else. When your Go pro­gram is executed, the .rst function called will be main.main(), which mimics the behavior from C. Here we declare that function;</p>

<p>4   On line 8 we call a function from the package fmt to print a string to the screen. The string is enclosed with &ldquo; and may contain non-ASCII characters. Here we use Greek and Japanese.</p>

<p>Compiling and running code
The preferred way to build a Go program is to use the go tool. To build helloworld we just enter:
%   go build helloworld.go</p>

<p>This results in an executable called helloworld.
%   ./helloworld</p>

<p>Hello, world; or ..a aó.µ.; or
aa&gt;1µ´  &hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>Settings used in this book
• Go itself is installed in ˜/go, and $GOROOT is set to GOROOT=˜/go ;
• Go source code we want to compile ourself is placed in ˜/g/src and $GOPATH is set to GOPATH=˜/g . This variable comes into play when we start using packages (chapter
3).</p>

<p>Variables, types and keywords</p>

<p>In the next few sections we will look at the variables, basic types, keywords and control structures of our new language. Go has a C-like feel when it comes to its syntax. If you want to put two (or more) statements on one line, they must be separated with a semicolon (’;’). Normally you don’t need the semicolon.</p>

<p>Go is different from (most) other languages in that the type of a variable is speci.ed after the variable name. So not: int a, but a int. When declaring a variable it is assigned the “natural” null value for the type. This means that after var int, a has a value of
0. With var s string, s is assigned the zero string, which is &ldquo;&rdquo;.a
Declaring and assigning in Go is a two step process, but they may be combined. Compare the following pieces of code which have the same effect.
Listing 1.2. Declaration with = Listing 1.3. Declaration with :=
var a int a := 15
var b bool b := false
a = 15
b = false</p>

<p>On the left we use the var keyword to declare a variable and then assign a value to it. The code on the right uses := to do this in one step (this form may only be used inside functions). In that case the variable type is deduced from the value. A value of 15 indicates an int, a value of false tells Go that the type should be bool. Multiple var declarations may also be grouped; const and import also allow this. Note the use of parentheses:
var (</p>

<p>x int</p>

<p>b bool
)</p>

<p>Multiple variables of the same type can also be declared on a single line: var x, y int makes x and y both int variables. You can also make use of parallel assignment:
a, b := 20, 16</p>

<p>Which makes a and b both integer variables and assigns 20 to a and 16 to b.
A special name for a variable is _ (underscore). Any value assigned to it is discarded. In
this example we only assign the integer value of 35 to b and discard the value 34.</p>

<p>_, b := 34, 35</p>

<p>Declared but otherwise unused variables are a compiler error in Go. The following code generates this error: i declared and not used
package main</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<p>var i int
}</p>

<p>Boolean types
A boolean type represents the set of boolean truth values denoted by the predeclared constants true and false. The boolean type is bool.
Numerical types
Go has the well known types such as int. This type has the appropriate length for your machine, meaning that on a 32-bit machine it is 32 bits and on a 64-bit machine it is 64 bits. Note: an int is either 32 or 64 bits, no other values are de.ned. Same goes for uint.
If you want to be explicit about the length you can have that too with int32, or uint32. The full list for (signed and unsigned) integers is int8, int16, int32, int64 and byte, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64. With byte being an alias for uint8. For .oating point values there is float32 and float64 (there is no float type). A 64 bit integer or .oating point value is always 64 bit, also on 32 bit architectures.
Note however that these types are all distinct and assigning variables which mix these types is a compiler error, like in the following code:</p>

<p>Listing 1.4. Familiar types are still distinct
package main 1</p>

<p>func main() { 3</p>

<p>var a int + Generic integer type 4
var b int32 + 32 bits integer type 5
a=15 6</p>

<p>b=a+a + Illegal mixing of these types 7
b=b+5 + 5 is a constant, so this is OK 8 } 9
Gives the error on the assignment on line 7:
types.go:7: cannot use a + a (type int) as type int32 in assignment</p>

<p>The assigned values may be denoted using octal, hexadecimal or the scienti.c notation: 077, 0xFF, 1e3 or 6.022e23 are all valid.
Constants
Constants in Go are just that — constant. They are created at compile time, and can only be numbers, strings or booleans; const x = 42 makes x a constant. You can use iota c
to enumerate values.
const (</p>

<p>a= iota</p>

<p>b= iota
)</p>

<p>The .rst use of iota will yield 0, so a is equal to 0, whenever iota is used again on a new line its value is incremented with 1, so b has a value of 1.
You can even do the following, let Go repeat the use of = iota:
const (</p>

<p>a= iota</p>

<p>b + Implicitly b = iota )
You may also explicitly type a constant, if you need that:
const (</p>

<p>a=0 + Is an int now
b string = &ldquo;0&rdquo;
)</p>

<p>Strings
Another important built-in type is string. Assigning a string is as simple as:
s := &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strings in Go are a sequence of UTF-8 characters enclosed in double quotes (”). If you use the single quote (’) you mean one character (encoded in UTF-8) — which is not a string in Go.
Once assigned to a variable the string can not be changed: strings in Go are immutable. For people coming from C; the following is not legal in Go:
var s string = &ldquo;hello&rdquo;
s[0] = &lsquo;c&rsquo; + Change .rst char. to ’c’, this is an error</p>

<p>To do this in Go you will need the following:
cThe word [iota] is used in a common English phrase, ’not one iota’, meaning ’not the slightest difference’, in reference to a phrase in the New Testament: “until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law.”
[27]</p>

<p>7
s := &ldquo;hello&rdquo; c := []rune(s)
0 c[0] = &lsquo;c&rsquo;
1 s2 := string&copy;
2 fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%s\n&rdquo;, s2)
3</p>

<p>0 Convert s to an array of runes, see chapter 4 section “Conversions” on page 54;</p>

<p>1 Change the .rst element of this array;</p>

<p>2 Create a new string s2 with the alteration;</p>

<p>3 print the string with fmt.Printf.</p>

<p>Multi-line strings
Due to the insertion of semicolons (see [8] section “Semicolons”), you need to be careful with using multi line strings. If you write:
s :=    &ldquo;Starting part&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Ending part&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This is transformed into:
s :=    &ldquo;Starting part&rdquo;;</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Ending part&rdquo;;</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is not valid syntax, you need to write:
s :=    &ldquo;Starting part&rdquo; +
&ldquo;Ending part&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Go will not insert the semicolons in the wrong places. Another way would be to use raw string literals by using backquotes (<code>): 
s :=</code>Starting part
Ending part`</p>

<p>Be aware that in this last example s now also contains the newline. Unlike interpreted string literals the value of a raw string literal is composed of the uninterpreted charac­ters between the quotes.
Runes
Rune is an alias for int32. It is an UTF-8 encoded code point. When is this type useful? For instance, when iterating over characters in a string. You can loop over each byte (which is only equivalent to a character when strings are encoded in 8-bit ASCII, which they are not in Go!). So to get the actual characters you should use the rune type.
Complex numbers
Go has native support for complex numbers. To use them you need a variable of type complex128 (64 bit real and imaginary parts) or complex64 (32 bit real and imaginary parts). Complex numbers are written as re + imi, where re is the real part, im is the
.
imaginary part and i is the literal ’i’( -1). An example of using complex numbers:
var c complex64 = 5+5i;fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Value is: %v&rdquo;, c) will print: (5+5i)
Errors
Any non-trivial program will have the need for error reporting sooner or later. Because of this Go has a builtin type specially for errors, called error.
The Printf() verb %v, means “print the value in its default format”.
var e error creates a variable e of type error with the value nil. This error type is an
interface

Although Go does not support operator overloading (or method overloading for that mat­ter), some of the built-in operators are overloaded. For instance, + can be used for integers, .oats, complex numbers and strings (adding strings is concatenating them).</p>

<p>• select used to choose from different types of communication, see chapter 6;</p>

<p>• interface see chapter 5;</p>

<p>• struct is used for abstract data types, see chapter 4;</p>

<p>• type also see chapter 4.</p>

<p>Control structures
There are only a few control structures in Go d
. For instance there is no do or while loop, only a for. There is a (.exible) switch statement and if and switch accept an optional initialization statement like that of for. There also is something called a type switch and a multiway communications multiplexer, select (see
chapter
6).
The
syntax
is different (from that in C): parentheses are not required and the body must always be brace-delimited.
If-else
In Go an if looks like this:
if x&gt;0 { + { is mandatory
return y
} else {</p>

<p>return x
}</p>

<p>Mandatory braces encourage writing simple if statements on multiple lines. It is good style to do so anyway, especially when the body contains a control statement such as a return or break.
Since if and switch accept an initialization statement, it’s common to see one used to set up a (local) variable.
if err := Chmod(0664); err != nil { + nil is like C’s NULL
fmt.Printf(err) + Scope of err is limited to if’s body
return err
}</p>

<p>You can use the logical operators (see table 1.1) as you would normally:
if true &amp;&amp; true {
fmt.Println(&ldquo;true&rdquo;)</p>

<p>}
if ! false {</p>

<p>fmt.Println(&ldquo;true&rdquo;)
}</p>

<p>In the Go libraries, you will .nd that when an if statement doesn’t .ow into the next statement – that is, the body ends in break, continue, goto, or return – the unneces­sary else is omitted.
f, err := os.Open(name, os.O_RDONLY, 0)
if err != nil {</p>

<p>return err
}
doSomething(f)</p>

<p>This is an example of a common situation where code must analyze a sequence of error possibilities. The code reads well if the successful .ow of control runs down the page, eliminating error cases as they arise. Since error cases tend to end in return statements, the resulting code needs no else statements.
f, err := os.Open(name, os.O_RDONLY, 0)
if err != nil {</p>

<p>return err
}
d, err := f.Stat()
if err != nil {</p>

<p>dThis section is copied from [8].</p>

<p>return err
}
doSomething(f, d)</p>

<p>Syntax-wise the following is illegal in Go:
if  err  != nil<br />
{  + Must be on the same line as the if<br />
return  err<br />
}</p>

<p>See [8] section “Semicolons” for the deeper reasons behind this.</p>

<p>Goto
Go has a goto statement — use it wisely. With goto you jump to a label which must be de.ned within the current function. For instance, a loop in disguise:
func myfunc() {
i := 0</p>

<p>Here: + First word on a line ending with a colon is a label println(i) i++ goto Here + Jump
}</p>

<p>The name of the label is case sensitive.
For
The Go for loop has three forms, only one of which has semicolons.
for init; condition; post {} + Like a C for
for condition {} + Like a while
for { } + Endless loop
Short declarations make it easy to declare the index variable right in the loop.
sum := 0 for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ { sum += i + Short for sum = sum + i } + i ceases to exist after the loop
Finally, since Go has no comma operator and ++ and &ndash;are statements not expressions, if you want to run multiple variables in a for you should use parallel assignment.
// Reverse a for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i&lt;j; i, j = i+1, j-1 { a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i] + Parallel assignment
}</p>

<p>Break and continue
With break you can quit loops early. By itself, break breaks the current loop.
for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ { if i&gt;5 { break + Stop this loop, making it only print 0 to 5 }
println(i)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>With loops within loops you can specify a label after break. Making the label identify which loop to stop:
J:  for j := 0; j<5; j++ { 
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { 
if i>5 {</p>

<p>break J + Now it breaks the j-loop, not the i one }
println(i)</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<p>With continue you begin the next iteration of the loop, skipping any remaining code. In the same way as break, continue also accepts a label. The following loop prints 0 to 5.
for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ { if i&gt;5 { continue + Skip the rest of the remaining code in the loop }
println(i)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Range
The keyword range can be used for loops. It can loop over slices, arrays, strings, maps and
channels
(see
chapter
6).
range is an iterator that, when called, returns the next key-value pair from the thing it loops over. Depending on what that is, range returns different things.
When looping over a slice or array range returns the index in the slice as the key and value belonging to that index. Consider this code:
list := []string{&ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;d&rdquo;, &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;f&rdquo;}
for k, v := range list {
do what you want with k and v</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>0 Create a slice (see “Arrays, slices and maps” on page 14) of strings.</p>

<p>1   Use range to loop over them. With each iteration range will return the index as an int and the key as a string, starting with 0 and “a”.</p>

<p>2 k will have the value 0…5, and v will loop through “a”…“f”.
You can also use range on strings directly. Then it will break out the individual Unicode characters e
and their start position, by parsing the UTF-8.</p>

<p>The loop:
for pos, char := range &ldquo;a&lt;x&rdquo; { fmt.Printf(&ldquo;character &lsquo;%c&rsquo; starts at byte position %d\n&rdquo;, char , pos)
}</p>

<p>prints
character &lsquo;a&rsquo; starts at byte position 0 character &lsquo;.&rsquo; starts at byte position 1 character &lsquo;x&rsquo; starts at byte position 3 + &lt; took 2 bytes
eIn the UTF-8 world characters are sometimes called runes. Mostly, when people talk about characters, they mean 8 bit characters. As UTF-8 characters may be up to 32 bits the word rune is used. In this case the type of char is rune.
Switch
Go’s switch is very .exible. The expressions need not be constants or even integers; the cases are evaluated top to bottom until a match is found, and if the switch has no expression it switches on true. It’s therefore possible – and idiomatic – to write an if-else-if-else chain as a switch.
func unhex(c byte) byte {
switch {
case &lsquo;0&rsquo; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &lsquo;9&rsquo;:</p>

<p>return c -&lsquo;0&rsquo;</p>

<p>case &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &lsquo;f&rsquo;:
return c -&lsquo;a&rsquo; + 10
case &lsquo;A&rsquo; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &lsquo;F&rsquo;:</p>

<p>return c -&lsquo;A&rsquo; + 10
}
return 0</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>There is no automatic fall through, you can however use fallthrough to do just that. Without fallthrough:
switch i { case 0: + empty case body case 1:
f() + f is not called when i == 0!
}</p>

<p>And with:
switch i {
case 0: fallthrough
case 1:</p>

<p>f() + f is called when i == 0!
}</p>

<p>With default you can specify an action when none of the other cases match.
switch i {
case 0:
case 1:</p>

<p>f()
default:
g() + called when i is not 0 or 1</p>

<p>Cases can be presented in comma-separated lists.
func shouldEscape(c byte) bool { switch c { case &lsquo; &lsquo;, &lsquo;?&rsquo;, &lsquo;&amp;&lsquo;, &lsquo;=&rsquo;, &lsquo;#&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo;: + , as ”or”
return true
}
return false</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison routine for byte arrays that uses two switch statements:</p>

<p>0
func Compare(a, b []byte) int {</p>

<p>for     i := 0; i&lt; len(a) &amp;&amp; i &lt; len(b); i++ {
switch {
case a[i] &gt; b[i]:</p>

<p>return 1</p>

<p>case a[i] &lt; b[i]:
return -1</p>

<p>}
}
switch {
1
case len(a) &lt; len(b):</p>

<p>return -1
case len(a) &gt; len(b):</p>

<p>return 1
}
return 0
2</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>0   Compare returns an integer comparing the two byte arrays lexicographically. The resultwillbe0ifa==b,-1 ifa<b,and +1ifa>b;</p>

<p>1 Strings are equal except for possible tail;</p>

<p>2 Strings are equal.</p>

<p>Built-in functions
A small number of functions are prede.ned, meaning you don’t have to include any pack­age to get access to them. Table 1.3 lists them all.f</p>

<p>Table 1.3. Pre–de.ned functions in Go
close new panic complex
delete make recover real
len append print imag
cap copy println</p>

<p>These built-in functions are documented in the builtin pseudo package that is included in recent Go releases. close  is used in channel communication. It closes a channel, see chapter 6 for more on this.
delete is used for deleting entries in maps.
len and cap are used on a number of different types, len is used for returning the length of strings and the length of slices and arrays.
See section “Arrays, slices and maps” for the details of slices and arrays and the function cap.
new  is used for allocating memory for user de.ned data types.
See section “Allocation with new” on page 50.</p>

<p>make is used for allocating memory for built-in types (maps, slices and channels). See section “Allocation with make” on page 51.</p>

<p>f You can use the command godoc builtin to read the online documentation about the built-in types and functions.
copy  is used for copying slices. See section “Slices” in this chapter.</p>

<p>append  is for concatenating slices. See section “Slices” in this chapter.</p>

<p>panic, recover are used for an exception mechanism.
See the section “Panic and recovering” on page 29 for more.</p>

<p>print, println are low level printing functions that can be used without reverting to the fmt pack­age. These are mainly used for debugging.
complex, real, imag
all deal with complex numbers. Apart from the simple example we gave, we will not further explain complex numbers.</p>

<p>Arrays, slices and maps
Storing multiple values in a list can be done by utilizing arrays, or their more .exible cousin: slices. A dictionary or hash type is also available, it is called a map in Go.
Arrays
An array is de.ned by: [n]<type>, where n is the length of the array and <type> is the stuff you want to store. Assigning or indexing an element in the array is done with square brackets:
var arr [10]int
arr[0] = 42
arr[1] = 13
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;The first element is %d\n&rdquo;, arr[0])</p>

<p>Array types like var arr [10]int have a .xed size. The size is part of the type. They can’t grow, because then they would have a different type. Also arrays are values: As­signing one array to another copies all the elements. In particular, if you pass an array to a function it will receive a copy of the array, not a pointer to it.
To declare an array you can use the following: var a [3]int, to initialize it to something
other than zero use a composite literal: a := [3]int{1, 2, 3}. This can be shortened A composite literal to a := [&hellip;]int{1, 2, 3}, where Go counts the elements automatically. allows you to as- When declaring arrays you always have to type something in between the square brackets, sign a value directly either a number or three dots (&hellip;) when using a composite literal. to an array, slice or map. When using using multidimensional arrays you can use the following syntax: See the section
a := [2][2]int{ {1,2}, {3,4}}</p>

<p>“Constructors and composite literals” on page 52 for Slices more.
A slice is similar to an array, but it can grow when new elements are added. A slice always
refers to an underlying array. What makes slices different from arrays is that a slice is a Reference types are pointer to an array; slices are reference types, which means that if you assign one slice created with make. to another, both refer to the same underlying array. For instance, if a function takes a
slice argument, changes it makes to the elements of the slice will be visible to the caller, analogous to passing a pointer to the underlying array. With:
sl := make([]int, 10)</p>

<p>you create a slice which can hold ten elements. Note that the underlying array isn’t speci.ed. A slice is always coupled to an array that has a .xed size. For slices we de.ne
a capacity and a length. Figure
1.1
depicts the following Go code. First we create an  array of m elements of the type int: var array[m]int Next, we create a slice from this array: slice := array[:n] And now we have:
 • len(slice)== n ;</p>

<p>• cap(slice)== m ;</p>

<p>• len(array)== cap(array)== m .</p>

<p>Figure 1.1. Array versus slice</p>

<p>Given an array, or another slice, a new slice is created via a[I:J]. This creates a new slice which refers to the variable a, starts at index I, and ends before index J. It has length J-I.
// array[n:m], create a slice from array with elements n to m-1 a := [&hellip;]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
0 s1 := a[2:4]
1 s2 := a[1:5]
2 s3 := a[:]
3 s4 := a[:4]
4 s5 := s2[:]
5 s6 := a[2:4:5]
6</p>

<p>0 De.ne an array with 5 elements, from index 0 to 4;</p>

<p>1 Create a slice with the elements from index 2 to 3, this contains: 3, 4;</p>

<p>2 Create a slice with the elements from index 1 to 4, contains: 2, 3, 4, 5;</p>

<p>3   Create a slice with all the elements of the array in it. This is a shorthand for: a[0:len(a)];</p>

<p>4   Create a slice with the elements from index 0 to 3, this is thus short for: a[0:4], and yields: 1, 2, 3, 4;</p>

<p>5 Create a slice from the slice s2, note that s5 still refers to the array a.</p>

<p>6 Create a slice with the elements from index 3 to 3 and also set the cap to 4.
In the code listed in 1.5 we dare to do the impossible on line 8 and try to allocate some­ thing beyond the capacity (maximum length of the underlying array) and we are greeted with a runtime error.</p>

<p>Listing 1.5. Arrays and slices
package main</p>

<p>func main() {
var array [100]int + Create array, index from 0 to 99
slice := array[0:99] + Create slice, index from 0 to 98</p>

<p>slice[98] = &lsquo;a&rsquo; + OK
slice[99] = &lsquo;a&rsquo; + Error: ”throw: index out of range”</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>If you want to extend a slice, there are a couple of built-in functions that make life easier: append and copy.
From [10]:</p>

<p>The function append appends zero or more values x to a slice s and returns the resulting slice, with the same type as s. If the capacity of s is not large enough to .t the additional values, append allocates a new, suf.ciently large slice that .ts both the existing slice elements and the additional values. Thus, the returned slice may refer to a different underlying array.
s0 := []int{0, 0}
s1 := append(s0, 2) 0
s2 :=
s3 :=</p>

<p>0 append a single element, s1 == []int{0, 0, 2};</p>

<p>1 append multiple elements, s2 == []int{0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7};</p>

<p>2 append a slice, s3 == []int{0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0}. Note the three dots!
And
The function copy copies slice elements from a source src to a destination dst and returns the number of elements copied. Source and destination may overlap. The number of elements copied is the minimum of len(src) and len(dst).
var a = [&hellip;]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
var s= make([]int, 6)
n1 := copy(s, a[0:]) + n1 == 6,s == []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
n2 := copy(s, s[2:]) + n2 == 4, s == []int{2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5}</p>

<p>Maps
Many other languages have a similar type built-in. For instance, Perl has hashes, Python has its dictionaries and C++ also has maps (as part of the libraries). In Go we have the map type. A map can be thought of as an array indexed by strings (in its most simple form). In the following listing we de.ne a map which converts from a string (month abbreviation) to an int – the number of days in that month. The generic way to de.ne a map is with:
map[<from type>]<to type></p>

<p>monthdays := map[string]int{ &ldquo;Jan&rdquo;: 31, &ldquo;Feb&rdquo;: 28, &ldquo;Mar&rdquo;: 31, &ldquo;Apr&rdquo;: 30, &ldquo;May&rdquo;: 31, &ldquo;Jun&rdquo;: 30, &ldquo;Jul&rdquo;: 31, &ldquo;Aug&rdquo;: 31, &ldquo;Sep&rdquo;: 30, &ldquo;Oct&rdquo;: 31, &ldquo;Nov&rdquo;: 30, &ldquo;Dec&rdquo;: 31, + Comma required
}</p>

<p>Note to use make when only declaring a map: monthdays := make(map[string]int)
For indexing (searching) in the map, we use square brackets. For example, suppose we
want to print the number of days in December: fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d\n&rdquo;, monthdays[&ldquo;Dec
&ldquo;])
If you are looping over an array, slice, string, or map a range clause will help you again,
which returns the key and corresponding value with each invocation.</p>

<p>year := 0 for _, days := range monthdays { + key unused, hence _, days year += days
}</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Numbers of days in a year: %d\n&rdquo;, year)</p>

<p>Adding elements to the map would be done as:
monthdays[&ldquo;Undecim&rdquo;] = 30 + Add a month monthdays[&ldquo;Feb&rdquo;] = 29 + Overwrite entry -for leap years To test for existence , you would use the following[19]:</p>

<p>var value int
var present bool</p>

<p>value, present = monthdays[&ldquo;Jan&rdquo;] + If exists present has value true
+ Or better and more Go like v, ok := monthdays[&ldquo;Jan&rdquo;] + Hence, the ”comma ok” form
And .nally you can remove elements from the map:
delete(monthdays, &ldquo;Mar&rdquo;) + Delete ”Mar”, always rainy anyway
In general the syntax delete(m, x) will delete the map entry retrieved by the expres­sion m[x].</p>

<p>Answers
A1. (1) Documentation
1. The package fnv is in a subdirectory of hash, so you will only need godoc hash/fnv. All the built-in functions are also accesible by using godoc builtin.
A2. (0) For-loop
1. There are a multitude of possibilities, one of the solutions could be:
Listing 1.6. Simple for loop

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() { for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ { + See

<li>
The following is one possible solution:</li>
</ol>

<p>if  i  &lt;  10  {<br />

<p>Listing 1.7. For loop with an array
func main() { var arr [10]int + Create an array with 10 elements for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
arr[i] = i + Fill it one by one

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v&rdquo;, arr) + With %v Go prints the value for us
}</p>

<p>You could even do this in one fell swoop by using a composite literal:
a := [&hellip;]int{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} + Let Go count fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, a)</p>

<p>A3. (0) FizzBuzz
1. A possible solution to this simple problem is the following program.
Listing 1.8. Fizz-Buzz
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<p>const (
FIZZ = 3
BUZZ = 5</p>

var p bool
for i := 1; i &lt; 100; i++ {</p>

<p>p = false
if i%FIZZ == 0 {

<p>2 for-loop, see section ”For”</p>

<p>3 If divisible by FIZZ, print ”Fizz”;</p>

<p>4 And if divisble by BUZZ, print ”Buzz”. Note that we have also taken care of</p>

<p>the FizzBuzz case;</p>

<p>5 If neither FIZZ nor BUZZ printed, print the value;</p>

<p>6 Format each output on a new line.</p>

<p>A4. (1) Strings
1. This program is a solution:
Listing 1.9. Strings
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() {
str := &ldquo;A&rdquo;
for i := 0; i &lt; 100; i++ {</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%s\n&rdquo;, str)
str = str + &ldquo;A&rdquo; + String concatenation</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<ol>
<li>To answer this question we need some help from the unicode/utf8 package. First we check the documentation with godoc unicode/utf8 | less. When we read the documentation we notice func RuneCount(p []byte)int. Secondly we can convert string to a byte slice with
str := &ldquo;hello&rdquo;
b := []byte(str) + Conversion,
see
page
54</li>
</ol>

<p>Putting this together leads to the following program.
Listing 1.10. Runes in strings
package main</p>

<p>import (</p>

<p>&ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;unicode/utf8&rdquo;</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<p>str := &ldquo;dsjkdshdjsdh&hellip;.js&rdquo;</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;String %s\nLength: %d, Runes: %d\n&rdquo;, str,</p>

<p>len([]byte(str)), utf8.RuneCount([]byte(str)))</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>package main</p>

<p>import (</p>

<p>&ldquo;fmt&rdquo;
)</p>

<ol>
<li>Something along the lines of: func main() {
s := &ldquo;ðå. ai no Æl&rdquo;
r := []rune(s)
copy(r[4:4+3], []rune(&ldquo;abc&rdquo;))
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Before: %s\n&rdquo;, s);
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;After : %s\n&rdquo;, string&reg;)</li>
</ol>

<p>}</p>

<ol>
<li>Reversing a string can be done as follows. We start from the left (i) and the right
(j) and swap the characters as we see them:
Listing 1.11. Reverse a string
import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>func main() {</p>

<p>s := &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;</p>

<p>a := []rune(s) + Again a conversion
for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i&lt;j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {</p>

<p>a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i] + Parallel assignment
}</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%s\n&rdquo;, string(a)) + Convert it back
}</p>

<p>A5. (1) Average
1. The following code calculates the average.
sum := 0.0</p>

<p>switch len(xs) {
case 0:
avg = 0
default:
for _, v := range xs {
sum += v</p>

<p>}
avg = sum / float64(len(xs))
}</p>

<p>0 If the length is zero, we return 0;</p>

<p>1 Otherwise we calculate the average;</p>

<p>2 We have to convert the value to a float64 to make the division work.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Functions</p>

<p>“I’m always delighted by the light touch and stillness of early programming languages. Not much text; a lot gets done. Old programs read like quiet conversations between a well-spoken research worker and a well-studied mechanical colleague, not as a debate with a compiler. Who’d have guessed sophistication bought such noise?”
RICHARD P. GABRIEL
Functions are the basic building blocks of Go programs; all interesting stuff happens in them. A function is declared as follows:
Listing 2.1. A function declaration
type mytype int + New
type,
see
chapter
4</p>

<p>func (p mytype) funcname(q int) (r,s int) { return 0,0 }</p>

<p>0 The keyword func is used to declare a function;</p>

<p>1   A function can optionally be bound to a speci.c type. This is called the receiver.A function
with
a
receiver
is
a
method.
This
will
be
explored
in
chapter
5;</p>

<p>2 funcname is the name of your function;</p>

<p>3   The variable q of type int is the input parameter. The parameters are passed pass­by-value meaning they are copied;</p>

<p>4   The variables r and s are the named return parameters for this function. Functions in Go can have multiple return values, see section ”Multiple return values” on page  26.
If you want the return parameters not to be named you only give the types: (int,int). If you have only one value to return you may omit the parentheses. If your function is a subroutine and does not have anything to return you may omit this entirely;</p>

<p>5   This is the function’s body. Note that return is a statement so the braces around the parameter(s) are optional.
Here are two examples. The .rst is a function without a return value, while the bottom one is a simple function that returns its input.
func subroutine(in int) { return }</p>

<p>func identity(in int) int { return in }</p>

<p>Functions can be declared in any order you wish. The compiler scans the entire .le before execution, so function prototyping is a thing of the past in Go. Go disallows nested func­tions, but you can work around this with anonymous functions. See section “Functions as values” on page 28 in this chapter.</p>

<p>Recursive functions work just as in other languages:
Listing 2.2. Recursive function
func rec(i int) {
if i == 10 {
return
}</p>

<p>rec(i+1)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d &ldquo;, i)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>This prints: 9876543210.
Scope
Variables declared outside any functions are global in Go, those de.ned in functions are local to those functions. If names overlap — a local variable is declared with the same name as a global one — the local variable hides the global one when the current function is executed.
Listing 2.3. Local scope Listing 2.4. Global scope
package main package main</p>

<p>var a=6
var a=6</p>

<p>func main() { func main() {
p()</p>

<p>p()
q()</p>

<p>q()
p()</p>

<p>p()</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>func p() {</p>

<p>func p() {
println(a) println(a)</p>

<p>}}</p>

<p>func q() { func q() {
a := 5</p>

<ul>
<li>De.nition a=5
println(a)</li>
</ul>

<p>println(a)</p>

<p>}}</p>

<p>In listing 2.3 we introduce a local variable a in the function q(). The local a is only visible in q(). This is why the code will print: 656.
In listing 2.4 no new variables are introduced, there is only a global a. Assigning a new value to a will be globally visible. This code will print: 655
In the following example we call g() from f():
Listing 2.5. Scope when calling functions from functions
package main</p>

<p>var a int</p>

<p>func main() {
a=5
println(a)
f()</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>func f() {</p>

<p>a := 6
println(a)
g()</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>func g() {
println(a)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>The output will be: 565.A local variable is only valid when we are executing the function in which it is de.ned.</p>

<p>Multiple return values
One of Go’s unusual (for compiled languages) features is that functions and methods can return multiple values (Python and Perl can do this too). This can be used to improve on a couple of clumsy idioms in C programs: in-band error returns (such as -1 for EOF) and modifying an argument. In Go, Write returns a count and an error: “Yes, you wrote some bytes but not all of them because you .lled the device”. The signature of *File.Write in package os is:
func (file *File) Write(b []byte) (n int, err error)</p>

<p>and as the documentation says, it returns the number of bytes written and a non-nil error when n != len(b). This is a common style in Go.
In the absence of tuples as a native type, multiple return values are the next best thing. You can return precisely what you want without overloading the domain space with spe­cial values to signal errors.</p>

<p>Named result parameters
The return or result parameters of a Go function can be given names and used as regular variables, just like the incoming parameters. When named, they are initialized to the zero values for their types when the function begins. If the function executes a return statement with no arguments, the current values of the result parameters are returned. Using these features enables you (again) to do more with less code a
.
The names are not mandatory but they can make code shorter and clearer: they are doc­umentation. If we name the results of nextInt it becomes obvious which returned int is which.
func nextInt(b []byte, pos int) (value, nextPos int) { /* &hellip; */ }</p>

<p>Because named results are initialized and tied to an unadorned return, they can simplify as well as clarify. Here’s a version of io.ReadFull that uses them well:
func ReadFull(r Reader, buf []byte) (n int, err error) {</p>

<p>for len(buf) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; err == nil {</p>

<p>var nr int</p>

<p>nr, err = r.Read(buf)</p>

<p>n += nr</p>

<p>buf = buf[nr:len(buf)]</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>return
}</p>

<p>aThis is a motto of Go; “Do more with less code”</p>

<p>Deferred code
Suppose you have a function in which you open a .le and perform various writes and reads on it. In such a function there are often spots where you want to return early. If you do that, you will need to close the .le descriptor you are working on. This often leads to the following code:
Listing 2.6. Without defer
func ReadWrite() bool {
file.Open(&ldquo;file&rdquo;)
// Do your thing
if failureX {</p>

<p>file.Close() + Close() here
return false
}</p>

<p>if failureY {
file.Close() + And here&hellip;
return false</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>file.Close() + &hellip;And here return true }
A lot of code is repeated here. To overcome this Go has the defer statement. After defer you specify a function which is called just before the current function exits.
The code above could be rewritten as follows. This makes the function more readable, shorter and puts the Close right next to the Open.
Listing 2.7. With defer
func ReadWrite() bool { file.Open(&ldquo;file&rdquo;) defer file.Close() + file.Close() is added to defer list // Do your thing if failureX {
return false + Close() is now done automatically
}
if failureY {</p>

<p>return false + And here too
}
return true + And here</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>You can put multiple functions on the “deferred list”, like this example from [8]:</p>

<p>for i := 0; i&lt;5; i++ {
defer fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d &ldquo;, i)
}</p>

<p>Deferred functions are executed in LIFO order, so the above code prints: 43210.
With defer you can even change return values, provided that you are using named result parameters and a function literalb, i.e:
Listing 2.8. Function literal
defer func() { /* &hellip; */ }() + () is needed here
bA function literal is sometimes called a closure.
Or this example which makes it easier to understand why and where you need the braces:
Listing 2.9. Function literal with parameters
defer func(x int) {</p>

<p>/* &hellip; */ }(5) + Give the input variable x the value 5
In this (unnamed) function you can access any named return parameter:
Listing 2.10. Access return values within defer func f() (ret int) { + ret is initialized with zero defer func() { ret++ + Increment ret with 1 }() return 0 + 1 not 0 will be returned! }</p>

<p>Variadic parameters
Functions that take a variable number of parameters are known as variadic functions. To declare a function as variadic:
func myfunc(arg &hellip;int) {}</p>

<p>The arg &hellip;int instructs Go to see this as a function that takes a variable number of arguments. Note that these arguments all have the type int. Inside your function’s body the variable arg is a slice of ints:
for _,  n  :=  range arg {  0<br />
fmt.P rin tf(&ldquo;And  the  number  is:  %d\n&rdquo;, n)<br />
}</p>

<p>0   We are not interested in the index as returned by range, hence the use of the un­derscore here.
If you don’t specify the type of the variadic argument it defaults to the empty inter­face interface{} (see
chapter
5).
Suppose
we
have
another
variadic
function
called
myfunc2, the following example shows how to pass variadic arguments to it:
func myfunc(arg &hellip;int) { myfunc2(arg&hellip;) + Pass it as-is myfunc2(arg[:2]&hellip;) + Slice it
}</p>

<p>Functions as values
As with almost everything in Go, functions are also just values. They can be assigned to variables as follows:
Listing 2.11. Anonymous function
func main() { a := func() { + De.ne a nameless function and assign to a println(&ldquo;Hello&rdquo;)
} + No () here a() + Call the function
}</p>

<p>If we use fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%T\n&rdquo;, a) to print the type of a, it prints func(). Functions–as–values may be used in other places, for example maps. Here we convert from integers to functions:
Listing 2.12. Functions as values in maps
var xs = map[int]func() int{</p>

<p>1: func() int { return 10 },</p>

<p>2: func() int { return 20 },</p>

<p>3: func() int { return 30 }, + Mandatory ,
/* &hellip; */</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Or you can write a function that takes a function as its parameter, for example a Map function that works on int slices. This is left as an exercise for the reader (see exercise Q12
on
page
31).</p>

<p>Callbacks
Because functions are values they are easy to pass to functions, from where they can be used as callbacks. First de.ne a function that does “something” with an integer value:
func printit(x int) { + Function returns nothing fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, x) + Just print it
}</p>

<p>The signature of this function is: func printit(int), or without the function name: func(int). To create a new function that uses this one as a callback we need to use this signature:
func callback(y int,f func(int)) { + f has the function f(y) + Call the callback f with y
}</p>

<p>Panic and recovering
Go does not have an exception mechanism, like that in Java for instance: you cannot throw exceptions. Instead it uses a panic-and-recover mechanism. It is worth remembering that you should use this as a last resort, your code will not look, or be, better if it is littered with panics. It’s a powerful tool: use it wisely. So, how do you use it?
The
following
description
was
taken
from</p>

<p>Panic
is a built-in function that stops the ordinary .ow of control and begins panicking. When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. To the caller, F then behaves like a call to panic. The process continues up the stack until all functions in the current goroutine have returned, at which point the program crashes. Panics can be initiated by invoking panic directly. They can also be caused by runtime errors, such as out-of-bounds array accesses.
Recover is a built-in function that regains control of a panicking goroutine. Recover is only useful inside deferred functions. During normal execution, a call to recover will return nil and have no other effect. If the current goroutine is panicking, a call to recover will capture the value given to panic and resume normal execution.
This function checks if the function it gets as argument will panic when it is executedc:
cCopied from a presentation of Eleanor McHugh.
func throwsPanic(f func()) (b bool) { 0 defer func() { 1 if x := recover(); x != nil { b = true
} }() f() 2 return 3
}</p>

<p>0   We de.ne a new function throwsPanic that takes a function as an argument (see “Functions
as
values”).
It
returns
true
if
f panics when run, else false;
1   We de.ne a defer function that utilizes recover. If the current goroutine panics, this defer function will notice that. If recover() returns non-nil we set b to true;
2 Execute the function we received as the argument;
3   Return the value of b. Because b is
a
named
return
parameter
(page
26),
we
don’t
specify b.</p>

<p>Q14. (1) Bubble sort
1. Write a function that performs a bubble sort on a slice of ints. From [24]:</p>

<p>It works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements “bubble” to the top of the list.
[24] also gives an example in pseudo code:
procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )</p>

<p>do
swapped = false
for each i in 1 to length(A) -1 inclusive do:</p>

<p>if A[i-1] &gt; A[i] then

swapped = true</p>

<p>end if
end for

end procedure</p>

<p>Q15. (1) Functions that return functions
1. Write a function that returns a function that performs a +2 on integers. Name the function plusTwo. You should then be able do the following:
p := plusTwo()
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, p(2))
 Which should print 4. See section Callbacks on page 29 for information about this topic.
2. Generalize the function from 1, and create a plusX(x) which returns functions that add x to an integer.</p>

<p>Answers
A6. (0) Average
1. The following function calculates the average:
Listing 2.13. Average function in Go
func average(xs []float64) (avg float64) {
0
sum := 0.0
switch len(xs) {
case 0:
1</p>

<p>avg = 0 default:
2 for _, v := range xs { sum += v
}</p>

<p>avg = sum / float64(len(xs))
3 } return
4
}</p>

<p>0 We use a named return parameter;</p>

<p>1 If the length is zero, we return 0;</p>

<p>2 Otherwise we calculate the average;</p>

<p>3 We have to convert the value to a float64 to make the division work;</p>

<p>4 We have an avarage, return it.</p>

<p>A7. (0) Integer ordering
1. Here we can use the multiple return values (section “Multiple return values”) from Go:
func order(a, b int)(int, int) {
if a&gt;b {</p>

<p>return b,a
}
return a,b</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>A8. (1) Scope
1. The program does not even compile, because i on line 9 is not de.ned: i is only de.ned within the for-loop. To .x this the function main() should become:
func main() {
var i int
for i=0; i &lt; 10; i++ {</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, i)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, i)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Now i is de.ned outside the for-loop and still visible afterwards. This code will print the numbers 0 through 10.
A9. (1) Stack
1. First we de.ne a new type that represents a stack; we need an array (to hold the keys) and an index, which points to the last element. Our small stack can only hold 10 elements.
type stack struct { + stack is not exported
i int
data [10]int</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Next we need the push and pop functions to actually use the thing. First we show the wrong solution! In Go data passed to functions is passed-by-value meaning a copy is created and given to the function. The .rst stab for the function push could be:
func (s stack) push(k int) { + Works on copy of argument
if s.i+1 &gt; 9 {
return
}</p>

<p>s.data[s.i] = k
s.i++</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>The function works on the s which is of the type stack. To use this we just call s.push(50), to push the integer 50 on the stack. But the push function gets a copy of s, so it is not working the real thing. Nothing gets pushed to our stack this way, for example the following code:
var s stack + make s a simple stack variable
s.push(25)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;stack %v\n&rdquo;, s);
s.push(14)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;stack %v\n&rdquo;, s);</p>

<p>prints:
stack [0:0]
stack [0:0]</p>

<p>To solve this we need to give the function push a pointer to the stack. This means
we need to change push from</p>

<p>func (s stack)push(k int) -func (s *stack)push(k int)
We should now use new() (see “Allocation with new” in chapter 4) to create a  pointer to a newly allocated stack, so line 1 from the example above needs to be
s := new(stack)</p>

<p>And our two functions become:</p>

<p>func (s *stack) push(k int) {
s.data[s.i] = k
s.i++</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>func (s *stack) pop() int {
s.i-­return s.data[s.i]</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Which we then use as follows
func main() {
var s stack
s.push(25)
s.push(14)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;stack %v\n&rdquo;, s)</p>

<p>}</p>

<ol>
<li>While this was a bonus question, having the ability to print the stack was very valuable when writing the code for this exercise. According to the Go documen­tation fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v&rdquo;) can print any value (%v) that satis.es the Stringer interface. For this to work we only need to de.ne a String() function for our type:
Listing 2.14. stack.String()
func (s stack) String() string {
var str string
for i := 0; i &lt;= s.i; i++ {</li>
</ol>

<p>str = str + &ldquo;[&rdquo; +
strconv.Itoa(i) + &ldquo;:&rdquo; + strconv.Itoa
(s.data[i]) + &ldquo;]&rdquo;</p>

<p>}
return str
}</p>

<p>A10. (1) Var args
1. For this we need the &hellip;-syntax to signal we de.ne a function that takes an arbi­trary number of arguments.
Listing 2.15. A function with variable number of arguments
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() {
prtthem(1, 4, 5, 7, 4)
prtthem(1, 2, 4)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>func prtthem(numbers&hellip; int) { + numbers is slice of ints
for _, d := range numbers {
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d\n&rdquo;, d)</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<p>A11. (1) Fibonacci
1. The following program calculates Fibonacci numbers:
Listing 2.16. Fibonacci function in Go
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>func fibonacci(value int) []int {
x := make([]int, value)
0
x[0], x[1] = 1, 1
1</p>

<p>for n := 2; n &lt; value; n++ { x[n] = x[n-1] + x[n-2]
2
}
return x
3
}</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<p>for _, term := range fibonacci(10) {
4 fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v &ldquo;, term)
}
}</p>

<p>0 We create an array to hold the integers up to the value given in the function call;</p>

<p>1 Starting point of the Fibonacci calculation;</p>

<p>2 xn = xn-1 + xn-2;</p>

<p>3 Return the entire array;</p>

<p>4 Using the range keyword we “walk” the numbers returned by the Fibonacci function. Here up to 10. And we print them.
A12. (1) Map function
Listing 2.17. A Map function
1.
func Map(f func(int) int, l []int) []int {
j := make([]int, len(l))
for k, v := range l {</p>

<p>j[k] = f(v)</p>

<p>}
return j
}</p>

<p>func main() {
m := []int{1, 3, 4}
f := func(i int) int {</p>

<p>return i*i
}</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v&rdquo;, (Map(f, m)))</p>

<p>}</p>

<ol>
<li>Answer to question but now with strings
A13. (0) Minimum and maximum</li>
<li>This function returns the largest int in the slice l:
func max(l []int) (max int) {
0
max = l[0]
for _, v := range l {
1</li>
</ol>

<p>if v &gt; max {
2 max = v
}
}
return
3</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>0 We use a named return parameter;</p>

<p>1 Loop over l. The index of the element is not important;</p>

<p>2 If we .nd a new maximum, remember it;</p>

<p>3 A “lone” return, the current value of max is now returned.</p>

<ol>
<li>This function returns the smallest int in the slice l. It is almost identical to max:
func min(l []int) (min int) {
min = l[0]
for _, v := range l {</li>
</ol>

<p>if v &lt; min {
min = v</p>

<p>}
}
return</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>The interested reader may combine max and min into one function with a selector that lets you choose between the minimum or the maximum, or one that returns both values.
A14. (1) Bubble sort
1. Bubble sort isn’t terribly ef.cient, for n elements it scales O(n2). See QuickSort
[17] for a better sorting algorithm.
But bubble sort is easy to implement:</p>

<p>Listing 2.18. Bubble sort
func main() {
n := []int{5, -1, 0, 12, 3, 5}
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;unsorted %v\n&rdquo;, n)
bubblesort(n)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;sorted %v\n&rdquo;, n)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>func bubblesort(n []int) {
for i := 0; i&lt; len(n) -1; i++ {
for j := i + 1; j&lt; len(n); j++ {
if n[j] &lt; n[i] {
n[i], n[j] = n[j], n[i]</p>

<p>}
}
}
}</p>

<p>Because a slice is a reference type the bubblesort function works and does not need to return a sorted slice.
A15. (1) Functions that return functions
1.
func main() {
p2 := plusTwo()
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;,p2(2))</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>func plusTwo() func(int) int {
0
return func(x int) int { return x+2 }
1
}</p>

<p>0 De.ne a new function that returns a function. See how you you can just write down what you mean;
1 Function literals at work, we de.ne the +2–function right there in the return statement.
2. Here we use a closure:</p>

<p>func plusX(x int) func(int) int {
return func(y int) int { return x+y }
}</p>

<p>0 Again de.ne a function that returns a function;
1 Use the local variable x in the function literal.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Packages</p>

<p>“^”
Answer to whether there is a bit wise negation operator.
KEN THOMPSON
A package is a collection of functions and data. You declare a package with the package keyword. The .lename does not have to match the package name. The convention for package names is to use lowercase characters. Go packages may consist of multiple .les, but they share the package <name> line. Let’s de.ne a package even in the .le even.go.
Listing 3.1. A small package package even + Start our own namespace
func Even(i int) bool { + Exported function return i % 2 == 0 }
func odd(i int) bool { + Private function return i % 2 == 1 }
Names that start with a capital letter are exported and may be used outside your package (more on that later).
Now we just need to build the package. We create a directory under $GOPATH, and copy even.go there (see “Compiling and running code” in chapter 1).</p>

<p>% mkdir $GOPATH/src/even
% cp even.go $GOPATH/src/even
% go build
% go install</p>

<p>Now we can use the package in our own program myeven.go:
Listing 3.2. Use of the even package
package main</p>

<p>import (
0 &ldquo;even&rdquo; &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>func main() {
i := 5
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Is %d even? %v\n&rdquo;, i, even.Even(i))</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>0 Import the following packages;</p>

<p>1 The local package even is imported here;</p>

<p>2 The of.cial fmt package gets imported;</p>

<p>3   Use the function from the even package. The syntax for accessing a function from a package is <package>.Function().
% go build myeven.go
% ./myeven
Is 5 even? false</p>

<p>In Go, a function from a package is exported (visible outside the package, i.e. public) when the .rst letter of the function name is a capital, hence the function name Even. If we change our myeven.go on line 10 to use the unexported function even.odd:
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Is %d even? %v\n&rdquo;, i, even.odd(i))</p>

<p>We get an error when compiling, because we are trying to use a private function:
myeven.go:10: cannot refer to unexported name even.odd</p>

<p>To summarize:
• Public functions begin with a capital letter;</p>

<p>• Private functions begin with a lowercase letter.</p>

<p>This convention holds true for other labels (new types, global variables) de.ned in the package. Note that the term “capital” is not limited to US-ASCII -it extends to all bicam­eral alphabets (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian and Coptic).
Identi.ers
Names are as important in Go as in any other language. In some cases they even have semantic effect: for instance, the visibility of a name outside its package is determined by the case of its .rst character. It’s therefore worth spending a little time talking about naming conventions in Go programs.
The convention is to leave well-known legacy not-quite-words alone rather than try to .gure out where the capital letters go: Atoi, Getwd, Chmod. CamelCasing works best when you have whole words to work with: ReadFile, NewWriter, MakeSlice.
Package names
When a package is imported (with import), the package name becomes the accessor for the contents. After
import &ldquo;bytes&rdquo;</p>

<p>the importing package can talk about bytes.Buffer. It’s helpful if everyone using the package can use the same name to refer to its contents, so the package name should be good: short, concise and evocative. By convention packages are given lower-case single-word names; there should be no need for underscores or mixedCaps. Err on the side of brevity (since everyone using your package will be typing its name), and don’t worry about collisions a priori.
The package name is only the default name for imports. You can override the default accessor by providing your own name to the import statement:
import bar &ldquo;bytes&rdquo;</p>

<p>The function Buffer is now accessed as bar.Buffer. This means that the package name does not need to be globally unique; in the rare case of a collision the importing code can choose a different name to use locally. In any case confusion is rare because the .le name in the import determines just which package is being used.</p>

<p>Another convention is that the package name is the base name of its source directory; the package in src/pkg/compress/gzip is imported as compress/gzip but has name gzip, not compress_gzip and not compressGzip.</p>

<p>The importer of a package will use the name to refer to its contents, so exported names in the package can use that fact to avoid stutter. For instance, the buffered reader type in the bu.o package is called Reader, not BufReader, because users see it as bufio.Reader, which is a clear, concise name. Moreover, because imported entities are always addressed by their package name, bufio.Reader does not con.ict with io.Reader. Similarly, the function to make new instances of ring.Ring (package container/ring) —which is the de.nition of a constructor in Go—would normally be called NewRing, but since Ring is the only type exported by the package, and since the package is called ring, it’s called just New. Clients of the package see that as ring.New. Use the package structure to help you choose good names.</p>

<p>Another short example is once.Do (see package sync); once.Do(setup) reads well and would not be improved by writing once.DoOrWaitUntilDone(setup). Long names don’t automatically make things more readable. If the name represents something in­tricate or subtle, it’s usually better to write a helpful doc comment than to attempt to put all the information into the name.
Finally, the convention in Go is to use MixedCaps or mixedCaps rather than underscores to write multi-word names.
Documenting packages This text is copied from[8].</p>

<p>Every package should have a package comment, a block comment preceding the package clause. For multi-.le packages, the package comment only needs to be present in one .le, and any one will do. The package comment should introduce the package and provide information relevant to the package as a whole. It will appear .rst on the go doc page and should set up the detailed documentation that follows. An example from the of.cial regexp package:
/*
The regexp package implements a simple library for
regular expressions.</p>

<p>The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is:</p>

<p>regexp:</p>

<p>concatenation &lsquo;|&rsquo; concatenation</p>

<p>*/</p>

<p>package regexp</p>

<p>Each de.ned (and exported) function should have a small line of text documenting the behavior of the function. An example from the fmt package:
// Printf formats according to a format specifier and writes to standard
// output. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error
// encountered.
func Printf(format string, a &hellip;interface) (n int, err error)</p>

<p>Testing packages
In Go it is customary to write (unit) tests for your package. Writing tests involves the testing package and the program go test. Both have excellent documentation.
The go test program runs all the test functions. Without any de.ned tests for our even package, go test yields:
% go test
? even [no test files]</p>

<p>Let us .x this by de.ning a test in a test .le. Test .les reside in the package directory and are named *_test.go. Those test .les are just like other Go programs, but go test will only execute the test functions. Each test function has the same signature and its name should start with Test:
func TestXxx(t *testing.T)</p>

<p>When writing test you will need to tell go test whether a test was successful or not. A successful test function just returns. When the test fails you can signal this with the following functions [11]. These are the most important ones (see go doc testing or go help testfunc for more):
func (t *T) Fail()</p>

<p>Fail marks the test function as having failed but continues execution.
func (t *T) FailNow()</p>

<p>FailNow marks the test function as having failed and stops its execution. Any remaining tests in this .le are skipped, and execution continues with the next test.
func (t *T) Log(args &hellip;interface{})</p>

<p>Log formats its arguments using default formatting, analogous to Print(), and records the text in the error log.
func (t *T) Fatal(args &hellip;interface{})</p>

<p>Fatal is equivalent to Log() followed by FailNow().
Putting all this together we can write our test. First we pick a name: even_test.go. Then we add the following contents:
Listing 3.3. Test .le for even package
package even 1</p>

<p>import &ldquo;testing&rdquo; 3</p>

<p>func  TestEven(t *testing.T) {  5<br />
if  !  Even(2) {  6<br />
t.Log(&ldquo;2  should be even!&rdquo;)  7<br />
t.Fail()  8<br />
}  9<br />
}  10</p>

<p>Note that we use package even on line 1 -the tests fall in the same namespace as the package we are testing. This is not only convenient, but also allows tests of unexported functions and structures. We then import the testing package, and on line 5 we de.ne the only test function in this .le. The displayed Go code should not hold any surprises: we check if the Even function works OK. Now, the moment we’ve been waiting for, executing the test:
% go test
ok even 0.001s</p>

<p>Our test ran and reported ok. Success!
If we rede.ne our test function, we can see the result of a failed test:</p>

<p>// Entering the twilight zone
func TestEven(t *testing.T) {</p>

<p>if Even(2) {
t.Log(&ldquo;2 should be odd!&rdquo;)
t.Fail()</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<p>We now get:
FAIL even 0.004s
&mdash;FAIL: TestEven (0.00 seconds)
2 should be odd!
FAIL</p>

<p>And you can act accordingly (by .xing the test for instance).
Writing new packages should go hand in hand with writing (some) documentation and test functions. It will make your code better and it shows that you really put in the effort.
The Go test suite also allows you to incorperate example functions which serve as docu­mentation and as tests. These functions need to start with Example.
func ExampleEven() {
if Even(2) {
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Is even\n&rdquo;)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>// Output:
// Is even</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Those last two comments lines are part of the example, go test uses those to check the generated output with the text in the comments. If there is a mismatch the test fails.</p>

<p>Useful packages
The standard Go repository includes a huge number of packages and it is even possible to install more alongside your current Go installation. It is very enlightening to browse the $GOROOT/src/pkg directory and look at the packages. We cannot comment on each package, but the following are worth a mention: a</p>

<p>fmt Package fmt implements formatted I/O with functions analogous to C’s printf and scanf. The format verbs are derived from C’s but are simpler. Some verbs (%­sequences) that can be used:
%v
The value in a default format. when printing structs, the plus .ag (%+v) adds .eld names;
%#v
a Go-syntax representation of the value;
%T
a Go-syntax representation of the type of the value.
io
This package provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives. Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives, such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.
aThe descriptions are copied from the packages’ go doc. Extra remarks are type set in italic.
bu.o
This package implements buffered I/O. It wraps an io.Reader or io.Writer ob­ject, creating another object (Reader or Writer) that also implements the interface but provides buffering and some help for textual I/O.
sort The sort package provides primitives for sorting arrays and user-de.ned collections.
strconv The strconv package implements conversions to and from string representations of basic data types.
os The os package provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality. The design is Unix-like.
sync The package sync provides basic synchronization primitives such as mutual exclu­sion locks.
.ag The .ag package implements command-line .ag parsing. See “Command line argu­ ments” on page 87.
encoding/json The encoding/json package implements encoding and decoding of JSON objects as de.ned in RFC 4627 [2].
html/template
Data-driven templates for generating textual output such as HTML. Templates are executed by applying them to a data structure. Annotations in the template refer to elements of the data structure (typically a .eld of a struct or a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed. The template walks the structure as it executes and the “cursor” @ represents the value at the current location in the structure.
net/http The net/http package implements parsing of HTTP requests, replies, and URLs and provides an extensible HTTP server and a basic HTTP client.
unsafe The unsafe package contains operations that step around the type safety of Go pro­grams. Normally you don’t need this package.
re.ect The re.ect package implements run-time re.ection, allowing a program to manip­ulate objects with arbitrary types. The typical use is to take a value with static type interface{} and extract its dynamic type information by calling TypeOf, which returns an object with interface type Type.
See
chapter
5,
section
“Introspection
and
re.ection”.
os/exec The os/exec package runs external commands.</p>

<p>Exercises
Q16. (0) Stack as package
1. See the Q9 exercise. In this exercise we want to create a separate package for that code. Create a proper package for your stack implementation, Push, Pop and the Stack type need to be exported.
2. Write a simple unit test for this package. You should at least test that a Pop works after a Push.</p>

<p>Q17. (2) Calculator
1. Create a reverse polish calculator. Use your stack package.</p>

<p>Answers
A16. (0) Stack as package
1. There are a few details that should be changed to make a proper package for our stack. First, the exported functions should begin with a capital letter and so should Stack. The package .le is named stack-as-package.go and contains:
Listing 3.4. Stack in a package
package stack</p>

<p>// Stack holds the items.</p>

<p>type Stack struct {
i int
data [10]int</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>// Push pushes an item on the stack.</p>

<p>func (s *Stack) Push(k int) {
s.data[s.i] = k
s.i++</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>// Pop pops an item from the stack.</p>

<p>func (s *Stack) Pop() (ret int) {
s.i-­ret = s.data[s.i]</p>

<p>return
}</p>

<ol>
<li>To make the unit testing work properly you need to do some preparations. We’ll come to those in a minute. First the actual unit test. Create a .le with the name pushpop_test.go, with the following contents:
Listing 3.5. Push/Pop test
package stack</li>
</ol>

<p>import &ldquo;testing&rdquo;</p>

<p>func TestPushPop(t *testing.T) {
c := new(Stack)
c.Push(5)
if c.Pop() !=5 {</p>

<p>t.Log(&ldquo;Pop doesn&rsquo;t give 5&rdquo;)
t.Fail()</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<p>For go test to work we need to put our package .les in a directory under $GOPATH/src:
% mkdir $GOPATH/src/stack
% cp pushpop_test.go $GOPATH/src/stack
% cp stack-as-package.go $GOPATH/src/stack</p>

<p>Yields:

<p>Beyond the basics</p>

<p>“Go has pointers but not pointer arithmetic. You cannot use a pointer variable to walk through the bytes of a string.”
Go For C++ Programmers
GO AUTHORS
Go has pointers. There is however no pointer arithmetic, so they act more like references than pointers that you may know from C. Pointers are useful. Remember that when you call a function in Go, the variables are pass-by-value. So, for ef.ciency and the possibility to modify a passed value in functions we have pointers.
You declare a pointer by pre.xing the type with an ’*’: var p*int. Now p is a pointer to an integer value. All newly declared variables are assigned their zero value and pointers are no different. A newly declared pointer, or just a pointer that points to nothing, has a nil-value. In other languages this is often called a NULL pointer in Go it is just nil. To make a pointer point to something you can use the address-of operator (&amp;), which we demonstrate here:
Listing 4.1. Use of a pointer
var p*int fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v&rdquo;, p) + Prints nil
var i int + Declare integer variable i p = &amp;i + Make p point to i
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v&rdquo;, p) + Prints something like 0x7ff96b81c000a
De-referencing a pointer is done by pre.xing the pointer variable with ’*’:
Listing 4.2. Dereferencing a pointer p = &amp;i + Take the address of i *p = 8 + Change the value of i fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, *p) + Prints 8 fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, i) + Idem
As said, there is no pointer arithmetic, so if you write: *p++, it is interpreted as (*p)++: .rst reference and then increment the value. a</p>

<p>Allocation
Go also has garbage collection, meaning that you don’t have to worry about memory
deallocation. To allocate memory Go has two primitives, new and make. They do different things and apply to different types, which can be confusing, but the rules are simple. The follow­ing sections show how to handle allocation in Go and hopefully clari.es the somewhat arti.cial distinction between new and make.
Allocation with new
The built-in function new is essentially the same as its namesakes in other languages: new(T) allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type T and returns its address, a value

<p>of type *T. In Go terminology, it returns a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of type
T. This is important to remember.
This means a user of the data structure can create one with new and get right to work. For example, the documentation for bytes.Buffer states that “the zero value for Buffer is an empty buffer ready to use.” Similarly, sync.Mutex does not have an explicit constructor or Init method. Instead, the zero value for a sync.Mutex is de.ned to be an unlocked mutex.
The zero-value-is-useful property works transitively. Consider this type declaration. See section “De.ning your own types” on page 52.
type SyncedBuffer struct {</p>

<p>lock sync.Mutex</p>

<p>buffer bytes.Buffer
}</p>

<p>Values of type SyncedBuffer are also ready to use immediately upon allocation or just declaration. In this snippet, both p and v will work correctly without further arrangement.
p := new(SyncedBuffer) + Type *SyncedBuffer, ready to use var v SyncedBuffer + Type SyncedBuffer, idem
Allocation with make
Back to allocation. The built-in function make(T, args) serves a purpose different from new(T). It creates slices, maps, and channels only, and it returns an initialized (not zero) value of type T, not *T. The reason for the distinction is that these three types are, under the covers, references to data structures that must be initialized before use. A slice, for example, is a three-item descriptor containing a pointer to the data (inside an array), the length, and the capacity; until those items are initialized, the slice is nil. For slices, maps, and channels, make initializes the internal data structure and prepares the value for use.
For instance, make([]int, 10, 100) allocates an array of 100 ints and then creates a slice structure with length 10 and a capacity of 100 pointing at the .rst 10 elements of the array. In contrast, new([]int) returns a pointer to a newly allocated, zeroed slice structure, that is, a pointer to a nil slice value. These examples illustrate the difference between new and make.
var p *[]int = new([]int) + Allocates slice structure;rarely useful var v []int = make([]int, 100) + v refers to a new array of 100 ints
var p *[]int = new([]int) + Unnecessarily complex *p = make([]int, 100, 100)
v := make([]int, 100) + Idiomatic
Remember that make applies only to maps, slices and channels and does not return a pointer. To obtain an explicit pointer allocate with new.
new allocates; make initializes
The above two paragraphs can be summarized as:
•
new(T) returns *T pointing to a zeroed T</p>

<p>•
make(T) returns an initialized T And of course make is only used for slices, maps and channels.</p>

<p>Constructors and composite literals
Sometimes the zero value isn’t good enough and an initializing constructor is necessary, as in this example taken from the package os.
func NewFile(fd int, name string) *File {
if fd &lt; 0 {</p>

<p>return nil
}
f := new(File)
f.fd = fd
f.name = name
f.dirinfo = nil
f.nepipe = 0
return f</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>There’s a lot of boiler plate in there. We can simplify it using a composite literal, which is an expression that creates a new instance each time it is evaluated.
func NewFile(fd int, name string) *File {
if fd &lt; 0 {</p>

<p>return nil
}
f := File{fd, name, nil, 0} + Create a new File
return &amp;f + Return the address of f</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>It is OK to return the address of a local variable; the storage associated with the variable survives after the function returns.
In fact, taking the address of a composite literal allocates a fresh instance each time it is evaluated, so we can combine these last two lines.b</p>

<p>return &amp;File{fd, name, nil, 0}</p>

<p>The items (called .elds) of a composite literal are laid out in order and must all be present. However, by labeling the elements explicitly as .eld:value pairs, the initializers can ap­pear in any order, with the missing ones left as their respective zero values. Thus we could say
return &amp;File{fd: fd, name: name}</p>

<p>As a limiting case, if a composite literal contains no .elds at all, it creates a zero value for the type. The expressions new(File) and &amp;File{} are equivalent.
Composite literals can also be created for arrays, slices, and maps, with the .eld labels being indices or map keys as appropriate. In these examples, the initializations work regardless of the values of Enone, and Einval, as long as they are distinct.
ar := [&hellip;]string{Enone: &ldquo;no error&rdquo;, Einval: &ldquo;invalid argument&rdquo;}
sl := []string{Enone: &ldquo;no error&rdquo;, Einval: &ldquo;invalid argument&rdquo;}
ma := map[int]string {Enone: &ldquo;no error&rdquo;, Einval: &ldquo;invalid argument</p>

<p>&rdquo;}</p>

<p>De.ning your own types
Of course Go allows you to de.ne new types, it does this with the type keyword:
type foo int</p>

<p>bTaking the address of a composite literal tells the compiler to allocate it on the heap, not the stack.
Creates a new type foo which acts like an int. Creating more sophisticated types is done with the struct keyword. An example would be when we want record somebody’s name (string) and age (int) in a single structure and make it a new type:
Listing 4.3. Structures
package main
import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>type NameAge struct {</p>

<p>name string + Not exported
age int + Not exported }
func main() {</p>

<p>a := new(NameAge)</p>

<p>a.name = &ldquo;Pete&rdquo;; a.age = 42</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, a)
}</p>

<p>Apropos, the output of fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, a) is
&amp;{Pete 42}</p>

<p>That is nice! Go knows how to print your structure. If you only want to print one, or a few, .elds of the structure you’ll need to use .<field name>. For example to only print the name:
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%s&rdquo;, a.name) + %s formats a string
More on structure .elds
As said each item in a structure is called a .eld. A struct with no .elds: struct {} Or one with fourc
.elds:
struct {</p>

<p>x, y int</p>

<p>A *[]int</p>

<p>F func()
}</p>

<p>If you omit the name for a .eld, you create an anonymous .eld, for instance:
struct {</p>

<p>T1 + Field name is T1
*T2 + Field name is T2
P.T3 + Field name is T3
x, y int + Field names are x and y</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Note that .eld names that start with a capital letter are exported, i.e. can be set or read from other packages. Field names that start with a lowercase are private to the current package.
The same goes for functions de.ned in packages, see chapter 3 for the details.
Methods
If you create functions that work on your newly de.ned type, you can take two routes:
1. Create a function that takes the type as an argument.
cYes, four (4).
func doSomething(n1 <em>NameAge, n2 int) { /</em> */ }</p>

<p>This is (you might have guessed) a function call.
2. Create a function that works on the type (see receiver in
listing
2.1):</p>

<p>func (n1 <em>NameAge) doSomething(n2 int) { /</em> */ }</p>

<p>This is a method call, which can be used as:
var n *NameAge</p>

<p>n.doSomething(2)</p>

<p>Whether to use a function or method is entirely up to the programmer, but if you want to satisfy an interface (see the next chapter) you must use methods. If no such requirement exists it is a matter of taste whether to use functions or methods.
But
keep
the
following
in
mind,
this
is
quoted
from</p>

<p>If x is addressable and &amp;x’s method set contains m, x.m() is shorthand for (&amp;x).m().
In the above case this means that the following is not an error:
var n NameAge + Not a pointer n.doSomething(2)
Here Go will search the method list for n of type NameAge, come up empty and will then also search the method list for the type <em>NameAge and will translate this call to (&amp;n). doSomething(2).
There is a subtle but major difference between the following type declarations. Also see [10, section “Type Declarations”]. Suppose we have:
// A Mutex is a data type with two methods, Lock and Unlock.
type Mutex struct { /</em> Mutex fields */ }
func (m <em>Mutex) Lock() { /</em> Lock impl. */ }
func (m <em>Mutex) Unlock() { /</em> Unlock impl. */ }</p>

<p>We now create two types in two different manners:
•
type NewMutex Mutex;</p>

<p>•
type PrintableMutex struct{Mutex}.</p>

<p>NewMutex is equal to Mutex, but it does not have any of the methods of Mutex. In other words its method set is empty. But PrintableMutex has inherited the method set from Mutex. The Go term for this is embedding.
In
the
words
of</p>

<p>The method set of *PrintableMutex contains the methods Lock and Unlock bound to its anonymous .eld Mutex.</p>

<p>Conversions
Sometimes you want to convert a type to another type. This is possible in Go, but there are some rules. For starters, converting from one value to another is done by operators (that look like functions: byte()) and not all conversions are allowed.
Table 4.1. Valid conversions, float64 works the same as float32. Note that .oat32 has been abbreviated to .t32 in this table to make it .t on the page.
From b []byte i []int r []rune s string f flt32 i int
To<br />
[]byte × []int []rune string striftl32 int  ng(b)  × × string(i) string&reg;  []byte(s) []int(s) []rune(s) ×  × int(f)  flt32(i) ×<br />
• From a strmystring  ing :=  to a slice of bytes or runes. &ldquo;hello this is string&rdquo;<br />
byteslice  :=  []byte(mystring)</p>

<p>Converts to a byte slice, each byte contains the integer value of the corresponding byte in the string. Note that as strings in Go are encoded in UTF-8 some characters in the string may end up in 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes.
runeslice := []rune(mystring)</p>

<p>Converts to an rune slice, each rune contains a Unicode code point. Every character from the string corresponds to one rune.
• From a slice of bytes or runes to a string.
b := []byte{&lsquo;h&rsquo;,&lsquo;e&rsquo;,&lsquo;l&rsquo;,&lsquo;l&rsquo;,&lsquo;o&rsquo;} + Composite literal
s := string(b)
i := []rune{257,1024,65}
r := string(i)</p>

<p>For numeric values the following conversions are de.ned:
• Convert to an integer with a speci.c (bit) length: uint8(int);</p>

<p>• From .oating point to an integer value: int(float32). This discards the fraction part from the .oating point value;</p>

<p>• The other way around: float32(int);</p>

<p>User de.ned types and conversions
How can you convert between the types you have de.ned yourself? We create two types here Foo and Bar, where Bar is an alias for Foo:
type foo struct { int } + Anonymous struct .eld type bar foo + bar is an alias for foo
Then we:
var b bar = bar{1} + Declare b to be a bar var f foo = b + Assign b to f
Which fails on the last line with:
cannot use b (type bar) as type foo in assignment</p>

<p>This can be .xed with a conversion:
var f foo = foo(b)</p>

<p>Note that converting structures that are not identical in their .elds is more dif.cult. Also note that converting b to a plain int also fails; an integer is not the same as a structure containing an integer.</p>

<p>Exercises
Q18. (1) Pointer arithmetic
1. In the main text on page 50 there is the following text:</p>

<p>…there is no pointer arithmetic, so if you write: *p++, it is interpreted as (*p)++: .rst dereference and then increment the value.
When you increment a value like this, for which types will it work?
2. Why doesn’t it work for all types?
Q19. (2) Map function with interfaces
1. Use the answer from exercise Q12, but now make it generic using interfaces. Make it at least work for ints and strings.
Q20. (1) Pointers
1. Suppose we have de.ned the following structure:
type Person struct {
name string
age int</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>What is the difference between the following two lines?
var p1 Person
p2 := new(Person)</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the difference between the following two allocations?
func Set(t *T) {
x=t</li>
</ol>

<p>}</p>

<p>and
func Set(t T) {
x= &amp;t</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Q21. (1) Linked List
1.
Make use of the package container/list to create a (doubly) linked list. Push the values 1, 2 and 4 to the list and then print it.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Create your own linked list implementation. And perform the same actions as in question
1</li>
</ol>

<p>Q22. (1) Cat
1.
Write a program which mimics the Unix program cat. For those who don’t know</p>

<p>this program, the following invocation displays the contents of the .le blah: % cat blah</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make it support the n .ag, where each line is numbered.</p></li>

<li><p>The solution to the above question given in 1 contains a bug. Can you spot and .x it?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Q23. (2) Method calls
1. Suppose we have the following program. Note the package container/vector was once part of Go, but has been removed when the append built-in was introduced. However, for this question this isn’t important. The package implemented a stack-like structure, with push and pop methods.
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;container/vector&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() {
k1 := vector.IntVector{}
k2 := &amp;vector.IntVector{}
k3 := new(vector.IntVector)
k1.Push(2)
k2.Push(3)
k3.Push(4)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>What are the types of k1, k2 and k3?
2. Now, this program compiles and runs OK. All the Push operations work even though the variables are of a different type. The documentation for Push says:
func (p *IntVector) Push(x int) Push appends x to the end of the vector.
So the receiver has to be of type *IntVector, why does the code above (the Push statements) work correct then?</p>

<p>Answers
A18. (1) Pointer arithmetic
1.
This will only work for pointers to point to numerical (int, uint, etc) values.</p>

<ol>
<li>
The ++ is only de.ned for numerical types and because there is no operator over­loading in Go it fails (compilation error) otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>A19. (2) Map function with interfaces
Listing 4.4. A generic map function in Go
1.
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;</p>

<p>//* define the empty interface as a type
type e interface{}</p>

<p>func mult2(f e) e {
switch f.(type) {
case int:</p>

<p>return f.(int)*2
case string:
return f.(string) + f.(string) + f.(string)</p>

<ul>
<li>f.(string)
}
return f</li>
</ul>

<p>}</p>

<p>func Map(n []e, f func(e) e) []e {
m := make([]e, len(n))
for k, v := range n {</p>

<p>m[k] = f(v)</p>

<p>}
return m
}</p>

<p>func main() {
m := []e{1, 2, 3, 4}
s := []e{&ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;d&rdquo;}
mf := Map(m, mult2)
sf := Map(s, mult2)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, mf)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, sf)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>A20. (1) Pointers
1.
In .rst line:   var p1 Person allocates a Person-value to p1. The type of p1 is Person.</p>

<p>The second line: p2 := new(Person) allocates memory and assigns a pointer to p2. The type of p2 is *Person.</p>

<ol>
<li>
In the second function, x points to a new (heap-allocated) variable t which con­tains a copy of whatever the actual argument value is.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the .rst function, x points to the same thing that t does, which is the same
thing that the actual argument points to.
So in the second function, we have an “extra” variable containing a copy of the
interesting value.</p>

6 Otherwise we could just print the line.
2. The bug show itself when the last line of the input does not contain a newline. Or worse, when the input contains one line without a closing newline nothing is shown at all. A better solution is the following program.

<p>A23. (2) Method calls
1.
The type of k1 is vector.IntVector. Why? We use a composite literal (the {}), so we get a value of that type back. The variable k2 is of *vector.IntVector, because we take the address (&amp;) of the composite literal. And .nally k3 has also the type *vector.IntVector, because new returns a pointer to the type.</p>

<ol>
<li>The answer is given in [10] in the section “Calls”, where among other things it says:</li>
</ol>

<p>A method call x.m() is valid if the method set of (the type of) x contains m and the argument list can be assigned to the parameter list of m. If x is addressable and &amp;x’s method set contains m, x.m() is shorthand for (&amp;x).m().
In other words because k1 is addressable and *vector.IntVector does have the Push method, the call k1.Push(2) is translated by Go into (&amp;k1).Push(2) which makes the type system happy again (and you too — now you know this).d</p>

<p>dAlso see section “Methods” in this chapter.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Interfaces</p>

<p>I have this phobia about having my body penetrated surgically. You know what I mean? eXistenZ TED PIKUL The following text In Go, the word interface is overloaded to mean several different things. Every type has is partly from [22].<br />
an interface, which is the set of methods de.ned for that type. This bit of code de.nes a struct type S with one .eld, and de.nes two methods for S.
Listing 5.1. De.ning a struct and methods on it
type S struct { i int }
func (p *S) Get() int { return p.i }
func (p *S) Put(v int) { p.i = v }</p>

<p>You can also de.ne an interface type, which is simply a set of methods. This de.nes an interface I with two methods:
type I interface {
Get() int
Put(int)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>S is a valid implementation for interface I, because it de.nes the two methods which I requires. Note that this is true even though there is no explicit declaration that S implements I.
A Go program can use this fact via yet another meaning of interface, which is an interface value:
func f(p I) {
0
fmt.Println(p.Get())
1
p.Put(1)
2</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>0 Declare a function that takes an interface type as the argument;</p>

<p>1 As p implements interface I it must have the Get() method;</p>

<p>2 Same holds for the Put() method.
Here the variable p holds a value of interface type. Because S implements I, we can call f passing in a pointer to a value of type S:
var sS; f(&amp;s)</p>

<p>The reason we need to take the address of s, rather than a value of type S, is because we de.ned the methods on s to operate on pointers, see the code above in listing
5.1. This is not a requirement — we could have de.ned the methods to take values — but then the Put method would not work as expected. The fact that you do not need to declare whether or not a type implements an interface means that Go implements a form of duck typing[26]. This is not pure duck typing, be­ cause when possible the Go compiler will statically check whether the type implements the interface. However, Go does have a purely dynamic aspect, in that you can convert from one interface type to another. In the general case, that conversion is checked at run time. If the conversion is invalid — if the type of the value stored in the existing interface value does not satisfy the interface to which it is being converted — the program will fail with a run time error.
Interfaces in Go are similar to ideas in several other programming languages: pure ab­stract virtual base classes in C++, typeclasses in Haskell or duck typing in Python. How­ever there is no other language which combines interface values, static type checking, dynamic run time conversion, and no requirement for explicitly declaring that a type sat­is.es an interface. The result in Go is powerful, .exible, ef.cient, and easy to write.
Which is what?
Let’s de.ne another type that also implements the interface I:
type R struct { i int }
func (p *R) Get() int { return p.i }
func (p *R) Put(v int) { p.i = v }</p>

<p>The function f can now accept variables of type R and S. Suppose you need to know the actual type in the function f. In Go you can .gure that out by using a type switch.
func f(p I) {</p>

<p>switch t := p.(type) {
0
case *S:
1
case *R:
2
case S:
3
case R:
4
default:
5
}
}</p>

<p>0   The type switch. Use (type) in a switch statement. We store the type in the variable t;</p>

<p>1 The actual type of p is a pointer to S;</p>

<p>2 The actual type of p is a pointer to R;</p>

<p>3 The actual type of p is a S;</p>

<p>4 The actual type of p is a R;</p>

<p>5 It’s another type that implements I.
Using (type) outside a switch is illegal. A type switch isn’t the only way to discover the type at run-time. You can also use a “comma, ok” form to see if an interface type implements a speci.c interface:
if t, ok := something.(I); ok {</p>

<p>// something implements the interface I</p>

<p>// t is the type it has
}</p>

<p>When you are sure a variable implements an interface you can use:
t   := something.(I)</p>

<p>Empty interface
Since every type satis.es the empty interface: interface{}. We can create a generic function which has an empty interface as its argument:
Listing 5.2. A function with an empty interface argument
func g(something interface{}) int {
return something.(I).Get()
}</p>

<p>The return something.(I).Get() is the tricky bit in this function. The value something has type interface{}, meaning no guarantee of any methods at all: it could contain any type. The .(I) is a type assertion which converts something to an interface of type I. If we have that type we can invoke the Get() function. So if we create a new variable of the type *S, we can just call g(), because *S also implements the empty interface.
s= new(S)
fmt.Println(g(s));</p>

<p>The call to g will work .ne and will print 0. If we however invoke g() with a value that does not implement I we have a problem:
Listing 5.3. Failing to implement an interface i := 5 + Make i a “lousy” int fmt.Println(g(i))
This compiles, but when we run this we get slammed with:
panic: interface conversion: int is not main.I: missing method Get</p>

<p>Which is completely true, the built-in type int does not have a Get() method.
Methods
Methods are functions that have a receiver (see chapter 2). You can de.ne methods on any type (except on non-local types, this includes built-in types: the type int can not have methods). You can however make a new integer type with its own methods. For example:
type Foo int</p>

<p>func (self Foo) Emit() {
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v&rdquo;, self)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>type Emitter interface {
Emit()</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Doing this on non-local (types de.ned in other packages) types yields:
Listing 5.4. Failure extending built-in types Listing 5.5. Failure extending non-local types
func (i int) Emit() { func (a *net.AddrError) Emit() {
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d&rdquo;, i) fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v&rdquo;, a)</p>

<p>}}</p>

<p>cannot define new methods cannot define new methods
on non-local type int on non-local type net.AddrError</p>

<p>69
Methods on interface types An interface de.nes a set of methods. A method contains the actual code. In other words, an interface is the de.nition and the methods are the implementation. So a receiver can not be an interface type, doing so results in a invalid receiver type &hellip; compiler error. The authoritative word from the language spec [10]:</p>

<p>The receiver type must be of the form T or *T where T is a type name. T is called the receiver base type or just base type. The base type must not be a pointer or interface type and must be declared in the same package as the method.<br />
Pointers to interfaces<br />
Creating a pointer to an interface value is a useless action in Go. It is in fact illegal to create a pointer to an interface value. The release notes for the release 2010-10-13 that made them illegal leave no room for doubt:<br />
The language change is that uses of pointers to interface values no longer automatically de-reference the pointer. A pointer to an interface value is more often a beginner’s bug than correct code. From the [9]. If not for this restriction, this code:</p>

<p>var buf bytes.Buffer io.Copy(buf, os.Stdin)<br />
would copy standard input into a copy of buf, not into buf itself. This is almost never the desired behavior.<br />
Interface names<br />
By convention, one-method interfaces are named by the method name plus the -er suf.x: Reader, Writer, Formatter etc.<br />
There are a number of such names and it’s productive to honor them and the function names they capture. Read, Write, Close, Flush, String and so on have canonical sig­natures and meanings. To avoid confusion, don’t give your method one of those names unless it has the same signature and meaning. Conversely, if your type implements a method with the same meaning as a method on a well-known type, give it the same name and signature; call your string-converter method String not ToString. A sorting example  Text [8]. copied  from Recall the Bubblesort exercise (Q14), where we sorted an array of integers:</p>

<p>func bubblesort(n []int) { for i := 0; i &lt; len(n)-1; i++ { for j := i + 1; j &lt; len(n); j++ { if n[j] &lt; n[i] { n[i], n[j] = n[j], n[i] } } } }<br />
A version that sorts strings is identical except for the signature of the function:<br />
func  bubblesortString(n []string) { /*  &hellip;  */ }<br />
Using this approach would lead to two functions, one for each type. By using interfaces we can make this more generic. Let’s create a new function that will sort both strings and integers, something along the lines of this non-working example:</p>

<p>The full mailing list discussion on this subject can be found
at
[14].</p>

<p>func sort(i []interface{}) {
0 switch i.(type) {
1 case string:
2
// &hellip;
case int:
// &hellip;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>return /* &hellip; */
3 }</p>

<p>0 Our function will receive a slice of empty interfaces;</p>

<p>1 Using a type switch we .nd out what the actual type is of the input;</p>

<p>2 And then sort accordingly;</p>

<p>3 Return the sorted slice.
But when we call this function with sort([]int{1, 4, 5}), it fails with: cannot use i (type []int) as type []interface in function argument
This is because Go can not easily convert to a slice of interfaces. Just converting to an interface is easy, but to a slice is much more costly. To keep a long story short: Go does not (implicitly) convert slices for you.
So what is the Go way of creating such a “generic” function? Instead of doing the type inference ourselves with a type switch, we let Go do it implicitly: The following steps are required:
1. De.ne an interface type (called Sorter here) with a number of methods needed for sorting. We will at least need a function to get the length of the slice, a function to compare two values and a swap function;
type Sorter interface {</p>

<p>Len() int + len() as a method
Less(i, j int) bool + p[j] &lt; p[i] as a method
Swap(i, j int) + p[i], p[j] = p[j], p[i] as a method
}</p>

<ol>
<li>De.ne new types for the slices we want to sort. Note that we declare slice types;
type Xi []int</li>
</ol>

<p>type Xs []string</p>

<ol>
<li>Implementation of the methods of the Sorter interface. For integers:
func (p Xi) Len() int {return len(p)}</li>
</ol>

<p>func (p Xi) Less(i int,j int) bool {return p[j] &lt; p[i]}</p>

<p>func (p Xi) Swap(i int,j int) {p[i], p[j] = p[j], p[i]}</p>

<p>And for strings:
func (p Xs) Len() int {return len(p)}</p>

<p>func (p Xs) Less(i int,j int) bool {return p[j] &lt; p[i]}</p>

<p>func (p Xs) Swap(i int,j int) {p[i], p[j] = p[j], p[i]}</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a generic Sort function that works on the Sorter interface.
func Sort(x Sorter) {
0
for i := 0; i &lt; x.Len() -1; i++ {
1
for j := i + 1; j &lt; x.Len(); j++ {
if x.Less(i, j) {</li>
</ol>

<p>x.Swap(i, j)</p>

<p>}
}
}
}</p>

<p>x is now of the Sorter type;</p>

<p>1 Using the de.ned functions, we implement Bubblesort.</p>

<p>We can now use your generic Sort function as follows:
ints := Xi{44, 67, 3, 17, 89, 10, 73, 9, 14, 8}
strings := Xs{&ldquo;nut&rdquo;, &ldquo;ape&rdquo;, &ldquo;elephant&rdquo;, &ldquo;zoo&rdquo;, &ldquo;go&rdquo;}</p>

<p>Sort(ints)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, ints)
Sort(strings)
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%v\n&rdquo;, strings)</p>

<p>Listing interfaces in interfaces
Take a look at the following example of an interface de.nition, this one is from the pack­age container/heap:
type Interface interface {</p>

<p>sort.Interface</p>

<p>Push(x interface{})</p>

<p>Pop() interface{}
}</p>

<p>Here another interface is listed inside the de.nition of heap.Interface, this may look odd, but is perfectly valid, remember that on the surface an interface is nothing more than a listing of methods. sort.Interface is also such a listing, so it is perfectly legal to include it in the interface.
Introspection and re.ection
In the following example we want to look at the “tag” (here named “namestr”) de.ned in the type de.nition of Person. To do this we need the re.ect package (there is no other way in Go). Keep in mind that looking at a tag means going back to the type de.nition. So we use the re.ect package to .gure out the type of the variable and then access the tag.
Listing 5.6. Introspection using re.ection
type Person struct {</p>

<p>name string &ldquo;namestr&rdquo; + &ldquo;namestr&rdquo; is the tag
age int
}</p>

<p>func ShowTag(i interface{}) { + Called with *Person
switch t := reflect.TypeOf(i); t.Kind() {</p>

<p>case reflect.Ptr: + A pointer, thus reflect.Ptr
tag := t.Elem().Field(0).Tag</p>

<p>0 We are dealing with a</p>

<p>Type and according to the documentation
a:
a
go doc reflect</p>

<p>// Elem returns a type’s element type.
// It panics if the type’s Kind is not Array, Chan, Map, Ptr, or Slice.</p>

<p>Elem() Type</p>

<p>So on t we use Elem() to get the value the pointer points to;</p>

<p>1   We have now dereferenced the pointer and are ”inside” our structure. We now use Field(0) to access the zeroth .eld;</p>

<p>2   The struct StructField has a Tag member which returns the tag-name as a string. So on the 0th .eld we can unleash .Tag to access this name: Field(0).Tag. This gives us namestr.
To make the difference between types and values more clear, take a look at the following code:
Listing 5.7. Re.ection and the type and value
func show(i interface{}) {
switch t := i.(type) {</p>

<p>case *Person:
t := reflect.TypeOf(i) + Type meta data
v := reflect.ValueOf(i) + Actual values
tag := t.Elem().Field(0).Tag
0
name := v.Elem().Field(0).String()
1</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<p>0   Here we want to get to the “tag”. So we need Elem() to redirect the pointer, access the .rst .eld and get the tag. Note we operate on t a reflect.Type;</p>

<p>1   Now we want to get access to the value of one of the members and we employ Elem() on v to do the redirection. Now we have arrived at the structure. Then we go to the .rst .eld Field(0) and invoke the String() method on it.
Figure 5.1. Peeling away the layers using re.ection. Going from
a *Person via Elem() using the methods described in go doc
reflect to get the actual string contained within.</p>

<p>Setting a value works similarly as getting a value, but only works on exported members. Again some code:
Listing 5.8. Re.ect with private member Listing 5.9. Re.ect with public member
type Person struct { type Person struct { name string + name Name string + Name age int age int
}}</p>

<p>func Set(i interface{}) { func Set(i interface{}) {
switch i.(type) { switch i.(type) {
case *Person: case *Person:</p>

<p>r := reflect.ValueOf(i) r := reflect.ValueOf(i)
r.Elem(0).Field(0).SetString(&rdquo; r.Elem().Field(0).SetString(&rdquo;
Albert Einstein&rdquo;) Albert Einstein&rdquo;)</p>

<p>}}
}}</p>

<p>The code on the left compiles and runs, but when you run it, you are greeted with a stack trace and a run time error:
panic: reflect.Value.SetString using value obtained using unexported</p>

<p>field The code on the right works OK and sets the member Name to “Albert Einstein”. Of course this only works when you call Set() with a pointer argument.</p>

<p>Exercises
Q24. (1) Interfaces and compilation
1. The code in listing 5.3 on page 68 compiles OK — as stated in the text. But when you run it you’ll get a runtime error, so something is wrong. Why does the code compile cleanly then?
Q25. (1) Pointers and re.ection
1. One of the last paragraphs in section “Introspection and re.ection” on page 71,
has the following words:
The code on the right works OK and sets the member Name to “Albert Ein­stein”. Of course this only works when you call Set() with a pointer argu­ment.
Why is this the case?
Q26. (2) Interfaces and max()
1. In exercise Q13 we created a max function that works on a slice of integers.
The question now is to create a program that shows the maximum number and that works for both integers and .oats. Try to make your program as generic as possible, although that is quite dif.cult in this case.</p>

<p>Answers
A24. (1) Interfaces and compilation
1. The code compiles because an integer type implements the empty interface and
that is the check that happens at compile time. A proper way to .x this is to test if such an empty interface can be converted and, if so, call the appropriate method. The Go code that de.nes the function g in listing
5.2
– repeated here:
func g(any interface{}) int { return any.(I).Get() }</p>

<p>Should be changed to become:<br />
func g(any interface{}) int if v, ok := any.(I); ok return v.Get() } return -1  { {  + Check if any can be converted + If so invoke Get() + Just so we return anything<br />
}</p>

<p>If g() is called now there are no run-time errors anymore. The idiom used is called “comma ok” in Go.
A25. (1) Pointers and re.ection
1. When called with a non-pointer argument the variable is a copy (call-by-value). So you are doing the re.ection voodoo on a copy. And thus you are not changing the original value, but only this copy.
A26. (2) Interfaces and max()
1. The following program calculates a maximum. It is as generic as you can get with Go.
Listing 5.10. Generic way of calculating a maximum
package main</p>

<p>func Less(l, r interface{}) bool {
0
switch l.(type) {
case int:</p>

<p>if _, ok := r.(int); ok { return l.(int) &lt; r.(int)
1 } case float32: if _, ok := r.(float32); ok { return l.(float32) &lt; r.(float32)
2 } } return false }
func main() {
var a, b, c int = 5, 15, 0
var x, y, z float32 = 5.4, 29.3, 0.0</p>

<p>if c=a; Less(a, b) {
3
c=b</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>if z=x; Less(x, y) {
4
z=y</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>println(c, z)</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>0 We could have chosen to make the return type of this function an interface{}, but that would mean that a caller would always have to do a type assertion to extract the actual type from the interface;</p>

<p>1 All parameters are con.rmed to be integers. Now perform the comparison;</p>

<p>2 Parameters are float32;</p>

<p>3 Get the maximum of a and b;</p>

<p>4 Same for the .oats.</p>

ROB PIKE
In this chapter we will show off Go’s ability for concurrent programming using channels and goroutines. Goroutines are the central entity in Go’s ability for concurrency. But what is a
goroutine?
From</p>

<p>They’re called goroutines because the existing terms — threads, coroutines, pro­cesses, and so on — convey inaccurate connotations. A goroutine has a simple model: it is a function executing in parallel with other goroutines in the same address space. It is lightweight, costing little more than the allocation of stack space. And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required.
A goroutine is a normal function, except that you start it with the keyword go.
ready(&ldquo;Tea&rdquo;, 2) + Normal function call go ready(&ldquo;Tea&rdquo;, 2) + ready() started as goroutine
The following idea for a program was taken from [20].
We run a function as two gorou­ tines, the goroutines wait for an amount of time and then print something to the screen. On the lines 14 and 15 we start the goroutines. The main function waits long enough, so that both goroutines will have printed their text. Right now we wait for 5 seconds on line 17, but in fact we have no idea how long we should wait until all goroutines have exited.
Listing 6.1. Go routines in action
func }  ready(w string, sec int) { time.Sleep(time.Duration(sec) fmt.Println(w, &ldquo;is ready!&rdquo;)  * time.Second)  8 9 10 11<br />
func  main() {  13</p>

<p>go ready(&ldquo;Tea&rdquo;, 2) 14</p>

<p>go ready(&ldquo;Coffee&rdquo;, 1) 15</p>

<p>fmt.Println(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting&rdquo;) 16</p>

<p>time.Sleep(5 * time.Second) 17
} 18</p>

<p>Listing
6.1
outputs:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m waiting + Right away Coffee is ready! + After 1 second Tea is ready! + After 2 seconds
If we did not wait for the goroutines (i.e. remove line 17) the program would be termi­nated immediately and any running goroutines would die with it. To .x this we need some kind of mechanism which allows us to communicate with the goroutines. This mecha­nism is available to us in the form of channels. A channel can be compared to a two-way pipe in Unix shells: you can send to and receive values from it. Those values can only be of a speci.c type: the type of the channel. If we de.ne a channel, we must also de.ne the type of the values we can send on the channel. Note that we must use make to create a channel:</p>

<p>ci := make(chan int)
cs := make(chan string)
cf := make(chan interface{})</p>

<p>Makes ci a channel on which we can send and receive integers, makes cs a channel for strings and cf a channel for types that satisfy the empty interface. Sending on a channel and receiving from it, is done with the same operator: &lt;-. Depending on the operands it .gures out what to do:
ci &lt;-1 + Send the integer 1 to the channel ci &lt;-ci + Receive an integer from the channel ci i := &lt;-ci + Receive from the channel ci and store it in i
Let’s put this to use.
Listing 6.2. Go routines and a channel
var c chan int</p>

<p>func ready(w string, sec int) {
time.Sleep(time.Duration(sec) * time.Second)
fmt.Println(w, &ldquo;is ready!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>c &lt;-1
}</p>

<p>func main() {
c= make(chan int)
go ready(&ldquo;Tea&rdquo;, 2)</p>

<p>go ready(&ldquo;Coffee&rdquo;, 1)
fmt.Println(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting, but not too long&rdquo;)
&lt;-c
&lt;-c
}</p>

<p>0   Declare c to be a variable that is a channel of ints. That is: this channel can move integers. Note that this variable is global so that the goroutines have access to it;</p>

<p>1 Send the integer 1 on the channel c;</p>

<p>2 Initialize c;</p>

<p>3 Start the goroutines with the keyword go;</p>

<p>4   Wait until we receive a value from the channel. Note that the value we receive is discarded;</p>

<p>5 Two goroutines, two values to receive.
There is still some remaining ugliness; we have to read twice from the channel (lines 14 and 15). This is OK in this case, but what if we don’t know how many goroutines we started? This is where another Go built-in comes in: select. With select you can (among other things) listen for incoming data on a channel.
Using select in our program does not really make it shorter, because we run too few goroutines. We remove the lines 14 and 15 and replace them with the following:
Listing 6.3. Using select
L:  for { 14
select { 15</p>

<p>case  &lt;-c:  16<br />
i++  17<br />
if  i  &gt;  1  {  18<br />
break  L  19<br />
}  20<br />
}  21<br />
}  22</p>

<p>We will now wait as long as it takes. Only when we have received more than one reply on the channel c will we exit the loop L.
Make it run in parallel
While our goroutines were running concurrently, they were not running in parallel. When you do not tell Go anything there can only be one goroutine running at a time. With runtime.GOMAXPROCS(n) you can set the number of goroutines that can run in parallel. From the documentation:
GOMAXPROCS sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simulta­
neously and returns the previous setting. If n &lt; 1, it does not change the current
setting. This call will go away when the scheduler improves.
If you do not want to change any source code you can also set an environment variable GOMAXPROCS to the desired value.
More on channels
When you create a channel in Go with ch := make(chan bool), an unbuffered channel for bools is created. What does this mean for your program? For one, if you read (value
:= &lt;-ch) it will block until there is data to receive. Secondly anything sending (ch&lt;-5) will block until there is somebody to read it. Unbuffered channels make a perfect tool for synchronizing multiple goroutines.
But Go allows you to specify the buffer size of a channel, which is quite simply how many elements a channel can hold. ch := make(chan bool, 4), creates a buffered channel of bools that can hold 4 elements. The .rst 4 elements in this channel are written without any blocking. When you write the 5th element, your code will block, until another goroutine reads some elements from the channel to make room.
In conclusion, the following is true in Go:
{
value == 0 -unbuffered)
ch := make(chan type, value)</p>

<p>value &gt; 0 -buffer value elements
Closing channels
When a channel is closed the reading side needs to know this. The following code will check if a channel is closed.
x, ok = &lt;-ch</p>

<p>Where ok is set to true the channel is not closed and we’ve read something. Otherwise ok is set to false. In that case the channel was closed.</p>

<p>Exercises
Q27. (1) Channels
1. Modify the program you created in exercise Q2 to use channels, in other words, the function called in the body should now be a goroutine and communication should happen via channels. You should not worry yourself on how the goroutine terminates.
2. There are a few annoying issues left if you resolve question 1.
One of the problems is that the goroutine isn’t neatly cleaned up when main.main() exits. And worse, due to a race condition between the exit of main.main() and main.shower() not all numbers are printed. It should print up until 9, but sometimes it prints only to 8. Adding a second quit-channel you can remedy both issues. Do this.a</p>

<p>Q28. (2) Fibonacci II
1. This is the same exercise as the one given page 31 in exercise 11. For complete­ ness the complete question:
The Fibonacci sequence starts as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,&hellip; Or in math­ematical terms: x1 = 1; x2 = 1; xn = xn-1 + xn-2 *n&gt; 2. Write a function that takes an int value and gives that many terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
But now the twist: You must use channels.
a You will need the select statement.</p>

<p>Answers
A27. (1) Channels
1. A possible program is:
Listing 6.4. Channels in Go
package  main  1<br />
import  &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;  3<br />
func  main() {  5<br />
ch  :=  make(chan  int)  6<br />
go shower(ch)  7<br />
for i  := 0; i &lt; 10; i++  {  8<br />
ch &lt;­i  9<br />
}  10<br />
}  11<br />
func  shower(c  chan  int) {  13<br />
for {  14<br />
j  :=  &lt;-c  15<br />
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d\n&rdquo;, j)  16<br />
}  17<br />
}  18</p>

<p>We start of in the usual way, then at line 6 we create a new channel of ints. In the next line we .re off the function shower with the ch variable as it argument, so that we may communicate with it. Next we start our for-loop (lines 8-10) and in the loop we send (with &lt;-) our number to the function (now a goroutine) shower.
In the function shower we wait (as this blocks) until we receive a number (line 15). Any received number is printed (line 16) and then continue the endless loop started on line 14.
2. An answer is
Listing 6.5. Adding an extra quit channel
package main 1</p>

<p>import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo; 3</p>

<p>func main() { 5
ch := make(chan int)6
quit := make(chan bool)7
go shower(ch, quit) 8
for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ { 9</p>

<p>ch &lt;-i 10
} 11
quit &lt;-false // or true, does not matter 12</p>

<p>} 13</p>

<p>func shower(c chan int, quit chan bool) { 15
for { 16
select { 17
case j := &lt;-c: 18
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d\n&rdquo;, j) 19
case &lt;-quit: 20
break 21
} 22</p>

} 24</p>

<p>On line 20 we read from the quit channel and we discard the value we read. We could have used q := &lt;-quit, but then we would have used the variable only once — which is illegal in Go. Another trick you might have pulled out of your hat may be: _= &lt;-quit. This is valid in Go, but the Go idiom favors the one given on line 20.

<p>Communication</p>

<p>“Good communication is as stimulating as black coffee, and just as hard to sleep after.”
ANNE MORROW LINDBERGH
In this chapter we are going to look at the building blocks in Go for communicating with the outside world. We will look at .les, directories, networking and executing other programs. Central to Go’s I/O are the interfaces io.Reader and io.Writer.
Reading from (and writing to) .les is easy in Go. This program only uses the os package to read data from the .le /etc/passwd.
Listing 7.1. Reading from a .le (unbuffered)
package main
import &ldquo;os&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() {
buf := make([]byte, 1024)</p>

<p>f, _ := os.Open(&ldquo;/etc/passwd&rdquo;)
defer f.Close()
for {</p>

<p>n, _ := f.Read(buf)
if n == 0 { break }
os.Stdout.Write(buf[:n])</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<p>The following is happening here:</p>

<p>0   Open the .le, os.Open returns a *os.File, which implements io.Reader and io.Writer;</p>

<p>1 Make sure we close f again;</p>

<p>2 Read up to 1024 bytes at the time;</p>

<p>3 We have reached the end of the .le;</p>

<p>4 Write the contents to os.Stdout
If you want to use buffered IO there is the bu.o package:
Listing 7.2. Reading from a .le (buffered)
package main
import ( &ldquo;os&rdquo;; &ldquo;bufio&rdquo;)</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<p>buf := make([]byte, 1024)
f, _ := os.Open(&ldquo;/etc/passwd&rdquo;)
defer f.Close()</p>

<p>r := bufio.NewReader(f)
w := bufio.NewWriter(os.Stdout)
defer w.Flush()
for {</p>

<p>n, _ := r.Read(buf)
2 if n == 0 { break } w.Write(buf[0:n])
}
}</p>

<p>0 Open the .le;</p>

<p>1   Turn f into a buffered Reader. NewReader expects an io.Reader, so you might think this will fail. But it does not. Anything that has such a Read() function implements this interface.
And
from
listing
7.1
we
can
see
that
*os.File indeed does so;</p>

<p>2 Read from the Reader and write to the Writer, and thus print the .le to the screen.
io.Reader
As mentioned above the io.Reader is an important interface in the language Go. A lot (if not all) functions that need to read from something take an io.Reader as input. To ful.ll the interface a type needs to implement only one method: Read(p []byte) (n int, err error). The writing side is (you may have guessed) an io.Writer, which has the Write method.
If you think of a new type in your program or package and you make it ful.ll the io.Reader or io.Writer interface, the whole standard Go library can be used on that type!</p>

<p>Some examples</p>

<p>The previous program reads a .le in its entirety, but a more common scenario is that you want to read a .le on a line-by-line basis. The following snippet shows a way to do just that:
f, _ := os.Open(&ldquo;/etc/passwd&rdquo;); defer f.Close() r := bufio.NewReader(f) + Make it a bu.o to access the ReadString method s, ok := r.ReadString(&rsquo;\n&rsquo;) + Read a line from the input // &hellip; + s holds the string, with the strings package you can parse it
A more robust method (but slightly more complicated) is ReadLine, see the documenta­
tion of the bu.o package.</p>

<p>A common scenario in shell scripting is that you want to check if a directory exists and if not, create one.</p>

<p>Listing 7.4. Create a directory with Go Listing 7.3. Create a directory with the shell
if f, e := os.Stat(&ldquo;name&rdquo;); e !=</p>

<p>if [ ! -e name ]; then</p>

<p>nil {</p>

<p>mkdir name</p>

<p>os.Mkdir(&ldquo;name&rdquo;, 0755)</p>

<p>else</p>

<p>}   else {</p>

<h1 id="error">error</h1>

<p>// error</p>

<p>fi</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>The similarity between these two examples have prompted comments that Go has a “script”-like feel to it, i.e. programming in Go can be compared to programming in an interpreted language (Python, Ruby, Perl or PHP).</p>

<p>Command line arguments
Arguments from the command line are available inside your program via the string slice os.Args, provided you have imported the package os. The .ag package has a more sophisticated interface, and also provides a way to parse .ags. Take this example from a DNS query tool:
dnssec := flag.Bool(&ldquo;dnssec&rdquo;, false, &ldquo;Request DNSSEC records&rdquo;)
0 port := flag.String(&ldquo;port&rdquo;, &ldquo;53&rdquo;, &ldquo;Set the query port&rdquo;)
1 flag.Usage = func() {
2
fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &ldquo;Usage: %s [OPTIONS] [name &hellip;]\n&rdquo;, os.</p>

<p>Args[0])</p>

<p>flag.PrintDefaults()
3 }
flag.Parse()
4</p>

<p>0   De.ne a bool .ag, -dnssec. The variable must be a pointer otherwise the package can not set its value;</p>

<p>1 Idem, but for a port option;</p>

<p>2 Slightly rede.ne the Usage function, to be a little more verbose;</p>

<p>3 For every .ag given, PrintDefaults will output the help string;</p>

<p>4 Parse the .ags and .ll the variables.
After the .ags have been parsed you can used them:
if *dnssec { + Dereference the dnssec .ag variable // do something
}</p>

<p>Executing commands
The os/exec package has functions to run external commands, and is the premier way to execute commands from within a Go program. It works by de.ning a *exec.Cmd structure for which it de.nes a number of methods. Let’s execute ls -l:
import &ldquo;os/exec&rdquo;</p>

<p>cmd := exec.Command(&ldquo;/bin/ls&rdquo;, &ldquo;-l&rdquo;) + Create a *cmd err := cmd.Run() + Run() it
The above example just runs “ls -l” without doing anything with the returned data, cap­turing the standard output from a command is done as follows:
import &ldquo;os/exec&rdquo;</p>

<p>cmd := exec.Command(&ldquo;/bin/ls&rdquo;, &ldquo;-l&rdquo;)
buf, err := cmd.Output() + buf is a ([]byte)</p>

<p>Networking
All network related types and functions can be found in the package net. One of the most important functions in there is Dial. When you Dial into a remote system the function returns a Conn interface type, which can be used to send and receive information. The function Dial neatly abstracts away the network family and transport. So IPv4 or IPv6, TCP or UDP can all share a common interface.
Dialing a remote system (port 80) over TCP, then UDP and lastly TCP over IPv6 looks like thisa:
aIn case you are wondering, 192.0.32.10 and 2620:0:2d0:200::10 are www.example.org.
89
conn, e := Dial(&ldquo;tcp&rdquo;, &ldquo;192.0.32.10:80&rdquo;)
conn, e := Dial(&ldquo;udp&rdquo;, &ldquo;192.0.32.10:80&rdquo;)
conn, e := Dial(&ldquo;tcp&rdquo;, &ldquo;[2620:0:2d0:200::10]:80&rdquo;)</p>

<ul>
<li>Mandatory brackets
If there were no errors (returned in e), you can use conn to read and write. The primitives de.ned in the package net are:
// Read reads data from the connection. Read(b []byte)(n int, err error)
This makes conn an io.Reader.
// Write writes data to the connection. Write(b []byte)(n int, err error)
This makes conn also an io.Writer, in fact conn is an io.ReadWriter. b
But these are the low level nooks and cranniesc, you will almost always use higher level packages. Such as the http package. For instance a simple Get for http:
package main import ( &ldquo;io/ioutil&rdquo;; &ldquo;http&rdquo;; &ldquo;fmt&rdquo; ) 0
func main() { r, err := http.Get(&ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/robots.txt&quot;">http://www.google.com/robots.txt&quot;</a>) 1 if err != nil { fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%s\n&rdquo;, err.String()); return }
2
b, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body) 3 r.Body.Close() if err == nil { fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%s&rdquo;, string(b)) } 4
}</li>
</ul>

<p>0 The imports needed;
1 Use http’s Get to retrieve the html;
2 Error handling;
3 Read the entire document into b;
4 If everything was OK, print the document.</p>

<p>Exercises
Q29. (2) Processes
1. Write a program that takes a list of all running processes and prints how many child processes each parent has spawned. The output should look like:
Pid 0 has 2 children: [1 2]
Pid 490 has 2 children: [1199 26524]
Pid 1824 has 1 child: [7293]</p>

<p>• For acquiring the process list, you’ll need to capture the output of ps -e -opid,ppid,comm. This output looks like:
PID  PPID  COMMAND<br />
9024  9023  zsh<br />
19560  9024  ps</p>

<p>bThe variable conn also implements a close method, this really makes it an io.ReadWriteCloser. cExercise
Q33
is
about
using
these.</p>

<p>•
If a parent has one child you must print child, if there is more than one print children;</p>

<p>•
The process list must be numerically sorted, so you start with pid 0 and work your way up.</p>

<p>Here is a Perl version to help you on your way (or to create complete and utter confusion).
Listing 7.5. Processes in Perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -l
my (%child, $pid, $parent);
my @ps=<code>ps -e -opid,ppid,comm</code>; + capture the output from ‘ps‘
foreach (@ps[1..$#ps]) { + discard the header line</p>

<p>($pid, $parent, undef) = split; + split the line, discard ’comm’ push @{$child{$parent}}, $pid; + save the child PIDs on a list }</p>

<h1 id="walk-through-the-sorted-ppids">Walk through the sorted PPIDs</h1>

<p>foreach (sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } keys %child) {
print &ldquo;Pid &ldquo;, $<em>, &ldquo; has &ldquo;, @{$child{$</em>}}+0, &ldquo; child&rdquo;,
@{$child{$<em>}} == 1 ? &ldquo;: &ldquo; : &ldquo;ren: &ldquo;, &ldquo;[@{$child{$</em>}}]&ldquo;;
}</p>

<p>Q30. (0) Word and letter count
1. Write a small program that reads text from standard input and performs the fol­lowing actions:
1.
Count the number of characters (including spaces);</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Count the number of words;</p></li>

<li><p>Count the numbers of lines.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In other words implement wc(1) (check you local manual page), however you only have to read from standard input.
Q31. (0) Uniq
1. Write a Go program that mimics the function of the Unix uniq command. This program should work as follows, given a list with the following items:
&lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;b&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;c&rsquo; &rsquo;d&rsquo; &lsquo;e&rsquo; &lsquo;f&rsquo; &lsquo;g&rsquo;</p>

<p>it should print only those item which don’t have the same successor:
&lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;b&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;c&rsquo; &rsquo;d&rsquo; &lsquo;e&rsquo; &lsquo;f&rsquo;</p>

<p>Listing

my @a = qw/a b a a a c d e f g/;
print my $first = shift @a;
foreach (@a) {</p>

<p>if ($first ne $<em>) { print; $first = $</em>;}
}</p>

<p>Q32. (2) Quine A Quine is a program that prints itself.
1. Write a Quine in Go.
Q33. (1) Echo server
1.
Write a simple echo server. Make it listen to TCP port number 8053 on localhost. It should be able to read a line (up to the newline), echo back that line and then close the connection.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Make the server concurrent so that every request is taken care of in a separate goroutine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Q34. (2) Number cruncher
• Pick six (6) random numbers from this list:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100
Numbers may be picked multiple times;
•
Pick one (1) random number (i) in the range: 1 &hellip; 1000;</p>

<p>•
Tell how, by combining the .rst 6 numbers (or a subset thereof) with the operators +,-,* and /, you can make i;</p>

<p>An example. We have picked the numbers: 1, 6, 7, 8, 8 and 75. And i is 977. This can be done in many different ways, one way is:
((((1 * 6) * 8) + 75) * 8) - 7 = 977
or
(8 * (75 + (8 * 6))) - (<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>) = 977
1.
Implement a number cruncher that works like that. Make it print the solution in a similar format (i.e. output should be in.x with parenthesis) as used above.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Calculate all possible solutions and show them (or only show how many there are). In the example above there are 544 ways to do it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Q35. (1) Finger daemon
1. Write a .nger daemon that works with the .nger(1) command.
From the Debian package description:
 Fingerd is a simple daemon based on RFC 1196 [28] that provides an inter­ face to the “.nger” program at most network sites. The program is supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment or a particular person in depth.
Stick to the basics and only support a username argument. If the user has a .plan .le show the contents of that .le. So your program needs to be able to .gure out:
• Does the user exist?<br />
• If the user exists, show the contents of the .plan .le.</p>

<p>Answers
A29. (2) Processes
1. There is lots of stuff to do here. We can divide our program up in the following sections:
1. Starting ps and capturing the output;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Parsing the output and saving the child PIDs for each PPID;</p></li>

<li><p>Sorting the PPID list;</p></li>

<li><p>Printing the sorted list to the screen</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the solution presented below, we’ve used a map[int][]int, i.e. a map indexed with integers, pointing to a slice of ints – which holds the PIDs. The builtin append is used to grow the integer slice.
A possible program is:
Listing 7.6. Processes in Go
package main
import ( &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;; &ldquo;os/exec&rdquo;; &ldquo;sort&rdquo;; &ldquo;strconv&rdquo;; &ldquo;strings&rdquo;)</p>

<p>func main() {
ps := exec.Command(&ldquo;ps&rdquo;, &ldquo;-e&rdquo;, &ldquo;-opid,ppid,comm&rdquo;)
output, _ := ps.Output()
child := make(map[int][]int)
for i, s := range strings.Split(string(output), &ldquo;\n&rdquo;</p>

<p>) { if i == 0 { continue } + kill .rst line if len(s) == 0 { continue } + kill last line f := strings.Fields(s) fpp, _ := strconv.Atoi(f[1]) + parent’s pid fp, _ := strconv.Atoi(f[0]) + child’s pid child[fpp] = append(child[fpp], fp)
}
schild := make([]int, len(child))
i := 0
for k, _ := range child { schild[i] = k; i++ }
sort.Ints(schild)
for _, ppid := range schild {</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Pid %d has %d child&rdquo;, ppid, len(
child[ppid]))
if len(child[ppid]) == 1 {
fmt.Printf(&rdquo;: %v\n&rdquo;, child[ppid])</p>

<p>continue
}</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;ren: %v\n&rdquo;, child[ppid])</p>

<p>}
}</p>

<p>A30. (0) Word and letter count
1. The following program is an implementation of wc(1).
Listing 7.7. wc(1) in Go
package main</p>

<p>import (</p>

<p>&ldquo;os&rdquo;
&ldquo;fmt&rdquo;
&ldquo;bufio&rdquo;
&ldquo;strings&rdquo;</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>func main() {
var chars, words, lines int
r := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
0</p>

<p>for { switch s, ok := r.ReadString(&rsquo;\n&rsquo;); true {
1 case ok != nil:
2
fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%d %d %d\n&rdquo;, chars,
words, lines);
return</p>

<p>default:
3 chars += len(s) words += len(strings.Fields(s)) lines++
}
}
}</p>

<p>0 Start a new reader that reads from standard input;</p>

<p>1 Read a line from the input;</p>

<p>2 If we received an error, we assume it was because of a EOF. So we print the</p>

<p>current values;
3 Otherwise we count the charaters, words and increment the lines.
A31. (0) Uniq
1. The following is a uniq implementation in Go.
Listing 7.9. uniq(1) in Go

first := list[0]</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;%s &ldquo;, first)

<p>var q = `</p>

<p>A33. (1) Echo server
1. A simple echo server might be:
Listing 7.11. A simple echo server
package main
import ( &ldquo;net&rdquo;; &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;;&ldquo;bufio&rdquo; )</p>

<p>func main() {
l, err := net.Listen(&ldquo;tcp&rdquo;, &ldquo;127.0.0.1:8053&rdquo;)
if err != nil {</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Failure to listen: %s\n&rdquo;, err.
Error())</p>

<p>}
for {
if c, err := l.Accept(); err == nil { Echo(c
) }
}
}</p>

<p>func Echo(c net.Conn) {
defer c.Close()
line, err := bufio.NewReader&copy;.ReadString(&rsquo;\n&rsquo;)
if err != nil {</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Failure to read: %s\n&rdquo;, err.
Error())</p>

<p>return
}
_, err = c.Write([]byte(line))
if err != nil {</p>

<p>fmt.Printf(&ldquo;Failure to write: %s\n&rdquo;, err.
Error())</p>

<p>return
}
}</p>

<p>When started you should see the following:
% nc 127.0.0.1 8053
Go is <em>awesome</em></p>

<p>Go is <em>awesome</em></p>

<ol>
<li>To make the connection handling concurrent we only need to change one line in our echo server, the line:
if c, err := l.Accept(); err == nil { Echo&copy; }</li>
</ol>

<p>becomes:
if c, err := l.Accept(); err == nil { go Echo&copy; }</p>

<li>When starting permrec we give 977 as the .rst argument:
% ./permrec 977
1+(((6+7)*75)+(<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>)) = 977 #1
&hellip; &hellip;
((75+(8*6))*8)-7 = 977 #542</li>
</ol>

<p>(((75+(8*6))*8)-7)*1 = 977 #543
(((75+(8*6))*8)-7)/1 = 977 #544</p>
