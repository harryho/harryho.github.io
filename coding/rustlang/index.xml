      <description>Mutability Rust encourages you to favor immutability. Itâ€™s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a value that we previously designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to bugs.
But mutability can be very useful. To make them mutable is simply adding mut in front of the variable name. In addition to allowing this value to change, mut conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing this variable value.</description>
