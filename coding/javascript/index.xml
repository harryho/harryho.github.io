      <description>The most confused keyword and feature I am sure you know I am talking about. Yes, this is not only a powerful feature, but also often misinterpreted keyword.
In JavaScript, we also have this concept inside a Function constructor when it is invoked using the “new” keyword, however it is not the only rule and “this” can often refer to a different object from a different execution context.
this can be anything  this represents different things.</description>
