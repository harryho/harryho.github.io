      <description>The most confused keyword and feature You may already guessed what I am talking about. Yes, thethis keyword. It is not only a powerful feature, but also often misinterpreted keyword.
In JavaScript, we also have this concept inside a Function constructor when it is invoked using the “new” keyword, however it is not the only rule and “this” can often refer to a different object from a different execution context.</description>
