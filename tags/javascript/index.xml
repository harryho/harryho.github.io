      <description>This starter was inspired by another similar angular webpack starter repository. It simply includes font-awesome, bootstrap for the people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to use boostrap-webpack, font-awesome-webpack. I find it saves us so much effort to create prototype, since we don&amp;rsquo;t need spectacular UI.
 This starter uses angular 1.5 for someone want to build component. This repo followes mvc patterns instead of component pattern. ES6, and ES7 support with babel.</description>
