      <title>Angularjs Webpack ES6 Starter</title>

      <description>This starter was inspired by another similar angular webpack starter repository. It simply includes font-awesome, bootstrap for the people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to use boostrap-webpack, font-awesome-webpack. I find it saves us so much effort to create prototype, since we don&amp;rsquo;t need spectacular UI.
 This starter uses angular 1.5 for someone want to build component. This repo followes mvc patterns instead of component pattern. ES6, and ES7 support with babel.</description>

      <description>What is JavaScript?  Please find the answer on Home Page  What is OOP?  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo;, which may contain data, in the form of fields, as known as attributes or properties; and actions, in the form of functions, as known as methods.
For example, Car is an object. The color and model of the car are attributes.</description>
