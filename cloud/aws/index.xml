      <description>IAM AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.
Root User  Every account has a root user in AWS. A root user is something that&amp;rsquo;s created automatically for you whenever you create an AWS account. Every single AWS account has a root user.</description>

      <description>AWS CLI Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you&amp;rsquo;ve defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you&amp;rsquo;d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
Profile Setup A named profile is a collection of settings and credentials that you can apply to a AWS CLI command. When you specify a profile to run a command, the settings and credentials are used to run that command.</description>

      <description>VPC Part 1 Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you&amp;rsquo;ve defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you&amp;rsquo;d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
Key concepts  A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.</description>

      <description>VPC Part 2 VPC has an implicit router (implied router), and you use route tables to control where network traffic is directed.
Route table  Have up to 200 route tables per VPC Have up to 50 route entries per route table Each subnet must be associated with only one route table The subent (when created) will be associated with main (default) VPC route table Can change the subnet association to another route table Can NOT delete the main route table Every route table in a VPC comes with a default rule that allows all VPC subnets to comminunicate with one another.</description>

      <description>VPC Part 3 Endpoint A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
Endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.</description>
